<h2 style="text-align:center;"><a>THOUGHTS AND PLANS FOR AO FUTURE</a></h2>
While there are a lot of things that could still be done to improve
the AO client, it's actually fairly stable at least on Linux. The
AO server lags far behind the client in terms of maturity and
stability and <b>unfortunately it must be considered deprecated.</b>
I have a plan to redo the server model completely
but at the moment my job does not leave me the time to do it.
<p>
The current Java-based server has a race condition; it works ok
for a single user but has a tendency to throw exceptions when
multiple builds are going on. The issue appears to involve some kind
of locking within the Java Persistence API. I suspect it's not a hard problem
to solve for someone with the right skills but I'm not really
a Java/SQL expert so I've struggled with it. In fact I've been
hoping for years that a Java/database guru would offer to
contribute some work to the server side but it hasn't happened.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I decided that a standard Java HTTP server isn't the
optimal solution anyway and that rather than fix it I should
retire it and rework AO to use Git in its low-level guise as a
"content-addressable filesystem" instead. The basic idea is to
check derived objects (aka DOs) into a Git repo and retrieve them
from there at recycle (aka winkin) time.  Note that this would be
a dedicated repo for AO, not the same one users might be using to
version their text files. In fact there's no expectation that Git
is being used as the SCM tool or is even installed.
Thus it would be wrong to say that AO would "use" Git in the
sense of an SCM tool, rather just that it would take advantage of
Git's underlying APIs for file storage and retrieval, compression,
digital signatures (SHA-1), cleanup (packing, garbage collection),
and in particular syncing between sites (push/pull).  This would
be implemented by linking with http://libgit2.github.com, not by
executing git commands directly.
</p>
<p>
The Git model would work much better in a distributed development
scenario because on a schedule of their choosing each local site
could "git push" and "git pull" to sync their DOs with remote
repos. During a build AO would look in the local clone and grab
DOs that match.
</p>
<p>
This is better for the reasons that DVCS is often better than
centralized VCS; disk space is cheap, network bandwidth and
time are expensive. With the Java server you pay the time
cost of dragging each DO over the network, potentially a WAN,
synchronously during the build whereas with the Git model it's
always present locally if available at all. True, there will be
some delay before DOs arrive at the local clone but that delay can
be a function of site policy (how often syncs happen). Consider
a distributed organization with sites in the US, India, China,
and Europe; each site's DOs are available for local reuse right
away, and at the remote sites as often as they're pushed. In
other words the slow operations (DO storage and transmission)
are handled asynchronously and the only synchronous operation
(winkin, or what AO calls recycling) is optimally fast.
</p>
<p>
I've got a back-of-the-envelope design for this which allows for
DO scrubbing (removal of old object files) a la ClearCase and very
quick lookups. It would completely remove the existing Perl script
placeholder and replace it with use of libgit2 which appears to be
stable enough for these purposes. One benefit of using libgit2,
aside from the efficiency that comes with staying in-process, is
that having git installed and on the path would not be necessary
for building. The systems that do advanced work such as syncs
with remote sites and scrubbing _might_ need a full Git install
but basic users would not. This would also set AO free from Git
version skew issues since only the internal version of libgit2
would matter.
</p>
<p>
The metadata that the current server keeps could also be stored
in a Git repo.
</p>
<p>
There also exist a number of web and GUI interfaces to Git which
could be used "for free" to browse through the DO repo. There are
many benefits to piggybacking on a popular format/tool like git.
