"ao_compared_with_clearmake">AO COMPARED WITH CLEARMAKE</a></h1>
<p>This document informally compares and contrasts AO with the
build tools bundled with ClearCase. We will use the term
<em>clearmake</em> generically to describe the build-side
capabilities of ClearCase, which more precisely encompass the
<em>clearmake</em> program along with <em>omake</em> and
<em>clearaudit</em> plus some <em>cleartool</em> commands such as
<em>catcr</em> and <em>diffcr</em>. For brevity we may also
abbreviate <em>clearmake</em> as CM and ClearCase as CC.</p>
<p>This comparison is not <em>inherently</em> a competitive one.
There are scenarios where having AO might free a user from needing
ClearCase, but there are also scenarios where AO can be used within
ClearCase to mutual benefit. It can even be used to augment the
capabilities of the clearmake program. So a number of viewpoints
are offered in differing degrees of competitive and
cooperative.</p>
<p>Unlike clearmake, AO is not a make program, is not derived from
any make program, and does not require the use of a make program.
Nevertheless, an understanding of make concepts and terms is
essential to this document. We will discuss the basic make model,
then how clearmake works, then how AO works, before getting into
comparisons. Also, the examples and terminology tend to show a Unix
bias but the basic concepts apply to Windows as well.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="the_make_paradigm">THE MAKE
PARADIGM</a></h1>
<p>The make program is simple and yet greatly misunderstood. This
is because it is merely a lightweight shell around far more complex
software. Just as a naive user might have trouble distinguishing
between Windows and the word processor in which he or she
spends most of their time, so someone unfamiliar with build technology may be
unable to separate the role of make from that of the compiler, linker,
etc. Take a look at a make help forum sometime; many of the
questions are really compiler or shell or general software
development issues.</p>
<p>There are three defining concepts in make: <em>target
files</em>, <em>prerequisite files</em>, and <em>commands</em>, aka <i>recipes</i>.
The person writing the makefile decides first what <em>targets</em>
need to be created. For each <em>target</em>, there is a set of
<em>prerequisites</em> - files which are used to create that
<em>target</em>. This set is associated with the <em>target</em>.
Then the Makefile writer simply needs to list the command (or
sequence of commands) which must be run to create the
<em>target</em> from the <em>prerequisites</em>.</p>
<p>When make is run, it reads the Makefile and, for each
<em>target</em> listed, looks at the associated
<em>prerequisites</em> and compares their ages. If any
<em>prerequisite</em> is newer than the <em>target</em>, the
<em>commands</em> are executed.</p>
<p>Make has <strong>no idea</strong> what those commands mean or
what they do, aside from the implicit promise made by the Makefile
writer that they will do something to update the targets. It
may be helpful to think of make as blindly writing the text
provided as <i>commands</i> to standard output. E.g. the
following two invocations are identical:</p>
<pre>
    % make
    % make -n | sh -x
</pre>
<p>aside from a few subtleties of quoting etc. In other words the
makefile writer provides a set of lines which are called
<em>commands</em> but which can really contain arbitrary text. Make
simply spits out a re-ordered subset of those text lines based on
which <em>prerequisites</em> have been modified. It actually sends
these lines to a program identified by the $(SHELL) variable but
that doesn't matter to make. The buck has been passed; to whom is
not important.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="what_ao_and_clearmake_have_in_common">WHAT
AO AND CLEARMAKE HAVE IN COMMON</a></h1>
<p>Before contrasting the two, we should be clear on why they're being compared at all,
i.e. what they do that's similar. Both clearmake and AO (when used as "ao make")
extend the above paradigm with concepts of <i>build auditing</i> (tracking and
storing build metadata), automatic <i>build avoidance</i> (deriving dependency
information on the fly), and <i>winkin</i>. All these are described in more
detail below; for now, suffice it to say that both clearmake and AO automatically
detect differences in command scripts and input files and can decide what to do
next based on those determinations.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="how_clearmake_works">HOW
CLEARMAKE WORKS</a></h1>
<p>There is not space here to fully describe clearmake, and its own
documentation does a better job anyway. It's assumed that readers
are either ClearCase users with access to documentation or come
from a different tradition and simply need the highlights for
comparison. So we restrict this to a few basic terms and
concepts.</p>
<p>Clearmake is based on make but takes advantage of the custom
filesystem (MVFS, or Multi-Version Filesystem) which is at the
heart of ClearCase. In particular, clearmake can ask to be alerted
whenever an MVFS file is opened. Thus, as commands are executed,
clearmake is apprised of which versions of which files were opened
by each command. This so-called <em>build audit</em> is recorded in
its internal database.</p>
<p>The audit information is often useful in its own right but
clearmake can put it to a couple of specific uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a id=
"item_build_avoidance">BUILD AVOIDANCE</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">This data eliminates the need for
explicit listing of prerequisite files. Clearmake can look in its
database and see what files are needed to create each target, and
can evaluate them to determine whether the target needs to be
rebuilt. If a prerequisite file is under ClearCase version control,
clearmake can record not only its basic info (size, date, etc) but
its version number. During subsequent builds it can compare
versions instead of date stamps, which is both more robust and more
flexible.</li>
<li><strong><a id=
"item_winkin">WINKIN</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">If a target need to be rebuilt, say
because the prerequisite file foo.h was updated, clearmake has one
more trick up its sleeve. It can look in the database and see if
some other user has built this target using the new version of
foo.h . If so, and assuming the rest of that user's build audit
matches the current state, clearmake can simply copy the target
from the remote user's build and skip the actual compilation (or
whatever) locally. This is called a wink-in . The process of
looking for a potential wink-in is called shopping .</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we can say that clearmake adds three major features
to base make: <em>auditing</em>, improved <em>build avoidance</em>,
and <em>winkin</em>. Auditing records a bill of materials for each
generated file, build avoidance can speed up incremental builds by
doing a better job than base make of knowing which targets to skip,
and winkin can speed up even full (non-incremental) builds by
borrowing prefabricated targets from previous builds.</p>
<p>ClearCase comes with a separate program called
<em>clearaudit</em> which provides the same audit facility as
clearmake but without doing any of the build avoidance or winkin
shopping. It merely records what files the audited process
used.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="how_ao_works">HOW AO WORKS</a></h1>
<h2><a id="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>Consider the clearmake situation again: there are two different
programs, clearaudit and clearmake, which between them provide the
three key features of <em>auditing</em>, <em>build avoidance</em>,
and <em>winkin</em>. Both clearaudit and clearmake do
<em>auditing</em>. But why can't clearaudit do build avoidance and
winkin? There is no logical reason clearaudit couldn't do these: at
the beginning of each clearaudited process, it has access to the
ClearCase database and could optionally wink in the results of a
matching previous run. The reason clearaudit cannot wink in is
non-obvious[*].</p>
<p>Imagine that it could, though, and you could use it with a make
program of your choice:</p>
<pre>
    clearaudit -winkin gmake ...
</pre>
<p>or really any program:</p>
<pre>
    clearaudit -winkin sh build.sh ...
</pre>
<p>This is the approach taken by AO. An experienced ClearCase user
can think of AO as clearaudit-with-winkin. When a program is run
under AO control:</p>
<pre>
    ao gmake ...
</pre>
<p>each build command is audited, the results are stored in a
database, and previous matches can be winked in or, in AO
terminology, <em>recycled</em>. We can now say that AO provides two
(auditing, winkin) of the three major clearmake features while
leaving the third (build avoidance) to the make program. There are
ways it can help with build avoidance too; these will be discussed
below.</p>
<p>[*] Without actually knowing ClearCase architecture, the
technical reason is likely to be that clearaudit lacks a way of
breaking the process tree into discrete &quot;transactions&quot;. The
abstraction offered by clearmake allows it to treat each target's
build script as a black box with well-defined inputs and outputs.
Clearaudit is not given this information. It could still offer
winkin as an all-or-nothing proposition, though.</p>
<h2><a id=
"user_space_vs_kernel_space">USER SPACE VS KERNEL SPACE</a></h2>
<p>As noted, clearmake depends on MVFS for its auditing capability.
MVFS is a custom filesystem, which means it must be installed as a
kernel extension. Installation may thus require a reboot. Perhaps
more importantly, this has subtle <code>knock-on effects</code>.
Every process on the system, even those of non-ClearCase users, is
now running against a nonstandard kernel configuration. A bug in
MVFS can <code>blue-screen</code> the entire system, taking
noncombatants with it.</p>
<p>AO works at a different level, entirely within the user-space
layer and with no elevated privileges. This means that not only is
there never an install-related reboot, there need not be an install
at all since the program can be run from a network share. Thus
there's no chance of it causing a system panic and no contamination
of the environment for unrelated processes. In fact it has
precisely zero effect on the user environment except when
explicitly invoked. There are both costs and benefits to this
approach, as seen below.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="ao_vs_clearmake">AO vs
CLEARMAKE</a></h1>
<p>We'll use a game-show-style head-to-head shootout for the comparison.
Each of the pros and cons below is annotated as a point to AO or
clearmake (CM). Of course some of these awards may be arguable and
in any case they're just a rough outline, but it's helpful for framing
further discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a id="item_activity">AO Finds
<strong>All</strong> File Activity (point:
AO)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">A significant limitation of clearmake
is that it can only audit MVFS files. Since OS files cannot
(generally) be in MVFS, this limits the value of the audit. For
instance, clearmake will not automatically record the state of
/usr/include/stdio.h should it be used. AO, on the other hand, is
completely agnostic with respect to the filesystem or location of
audited files.</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_promotion">AO Does
Immediate, Synchronous Promotion (point:
CM?)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">Clearmake leaves derived object files
in place and only promotes them (copies them up to the server) if
and when they're needed elsewhere. The original build is thus
not slowed by having to upload DO's as created, nor is network
bandwidth wasted by transferring files which may never be reused.
AO copies its derived objects to the server as they're created.
While this is arguably less elegant than clearmake's behavior,
there are a number of mitigating factors. AO files are compressed
at upload time, and users can opt to do download-only builds
(analogous to the express builds feature of clearmake). Uploads can
optionally be done asynchronously so the build is not waiting for
them. Perhaps most importantly, network bandwidth and disk space
are orders of magnitude cheaper than they were when ClearCase was
developed in the early 1990s. Last, promoting DOs ASAP is safer
and more robust; clearcase can get into all sorts of trouble when
trying to shop through views on machines which are down. AO does
one-stop shopping at the server because that's the only place
derived objects live.</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_program">AO Works With
Your Build Program (point: AO!)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">Clearmake is a large, idiosyncratic
program which attempts to be compatible with many make variants but
is 100% compatible with none. Very often, build systems need to be
rewritten to work with it which is not only costly but results in
vendor lock-in. And it is a make program, thus being no use for a
shell/perl/ant/etc script or an MSVC project. AO is 100% compatible
with any make program, not to mention many non-make programs.</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_versions">AO Doesn't
Record Versions (point: CM)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">By being tightly integrated with
CC, clearmake is able to record actual versions of prerequisites
(e.g. foo.c@@/main/167). AO, being SCM-system agnostic, cannot be
so tightly integrated out of the box. It records only the
standard metadata shared by all files (size, date, owner, etc) plus
a data hash similar to a CRC or MD5 which is used as a digital
fingerprint. However, with any SCM system which implements triggers it
should be possible to develop an adapter mapping AO version data to
SCM versions. A checkin trigger would calculate the data hash of
each new version and send the version/hash pair to the AO database
where it could be correlated with incoming audits. This is detailed
in the <a href="ao-vcs.html">AO and Version Control</a> document which gives a sample
implementation for ClearCase.</li>
<li><strong><a id=
"item_performance_cost_3a_5_2d20_25_vs_200_25__28point_3">Performance
Cost: 5-20% vs 200% (point: AO)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">It's generally estimated that an MVFS
file system, even when well configured and tuned, is two to three
times slower than a native filesystem. This gives rise to wide
swings in build times: when a build can be fully winked in it may
be orders of magnitude faster than a full build in a native
filesystem but if not, it may be 2 or 3 times slower than the
equivalent native build. AO provides the same potential speedup but
the fixed cost of doing an audited vs an unaudited full build
without winkins is closer to 10%. And of course much of what a
developer does is other than building: editing, testing, copying
files around, etc. A CC user pays the MVFS cost for every file
operation - even dumping core is slower in MVFS. Unit testing can be painful in a custom
filesystem. Consider a database developer working in a CC dynamic view; the
database may not work at all when run within MVFS, locking may
not work right, or it may just be painfully slow, so debugging is
complicated by the need to move files in and out of the view.
An AO user pays nothing except when building, and is of course free to do an
unaudited build if desired.</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_system">AO Doesn't
Modify the Host System (point: AO)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">ClearCase is quite intrusive to its
host system: the kernel is modified, pseudo-users created, daemons
started, ports opened, etc. This is not only complex to administer,
it also has security implications and prohibits certain uses. For
instance, ClearCase is often not allowed on production servers and
QA testbeds. AO involves no kernel changes, no daemons, and no open
ports (the server requires an open port but all client connections
are outbound).</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_flaws">CM is Strict,
Finds Makefile Flaws (point: ??)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">When a build system is being ported to
ClearCase, very often the initial builds fail miserably. This is
because clearmake is less tolerant of common problems like
dependency loops which regular make programs may ignore. This
strictness often causes developers to dislike ClearCase even though
the flaw is in their own code, but either way the pain is real. AO
does not force you to clean up in the same way. The relative
benefits here are in the eye of the beholder.</li>
<li><strong>CM *May* Record Out-of-Process Activity (point:
CM??)</strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">If a remote shell is used to invoke a
process on another system,
AO will not know about any filesystem activity caused by the remote
process. It is unclear whether clearmake would be told of such
remote MVFS activity. More
generally, AO audits the activity of one process tree : the
original audited program and its descendants, regardless of what
file system(s) they touch. Clearmake, on the other hand, audits
activity within one filesystem from the time the original audited
process is invoked till it ends, which *may* include remote or
out-of-process activity.</li>
<li><strong><a id="item_viral">ClearCase is Viral
(point: AO)</a></strong><br /></li>
<li style="list-style: none">Even if only some developers on a team
want or need clearmake, all members of the team must adopt
ClearCase (and pay license costs) to make that happen. Even for a
given user, in order to get the benefits of clearmake s/he must
live within MVFS all day, which means that such activities as
editing, unit testing, and file archiving must take place in a
nonstandard (and slow) filesystem. By contrast, AO has no
consequences unless invoked. If you evaluate it and don't like it,
you need only stop using it to be back where you were. If some team
members love it and others don't, each can have what they want. If
you're fighting a bug of your own and want to remove unneeded
complexity you can build without AO and come back to it later. If
you find a bug in AO itself you have the option of suspending use
until the bug is fixed. And of course, as mentioned above,
non-build activities (unit testing, editing, file coping) take
place in an unaltered environment. Bottom line, there is no
&quot;backout procedure&quot; needed for AO and no &quot;flag day&quot;
in adopting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise could go on but it has served its purpose by
raising the main points.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="uses_within_clearcase">USES
WITHIN CLEARCASE</a></h1>
<p>AO can also be complementary with clearmake. There are a few
different scenarios:</p>
<h2><a id="copybased_views">COPY-BASED
VIEWS</a></h2>
<p>Clearmake auditing and winkin work only within dynamic views.
But there's no reason clearmake couldn't be used in dynamic views
and AO in snapshot views. Of course those two sets of users
wouldn't be sharing DO's, but they could use the same Makefiles.
E.g. you could use clearmake in GNU-compatibility mode in dynamic
views and real GNU make under AO control in snapshot views. In fact
clearmake can itself be used under AO control in non-dynamic views,
with AO taking over the auditing/winkin job.</p>
<h2><a id="exported_views">EXPORTED
VIEWS</a></h2>
<p>Very similar to the above. If a view is mounted via NFS on a
system which does not have CC installed, AO can be used in place of
clearmake. Whatever the compatibility mode clearmake is being used
in, you can use the <code>real</code> version of that make under AO
control.</p>
<h2><a id=
"filling_in_clearmake_gaps">FILLING IN CLEARMAKE GAPS</a></h2>
<p>As noted previously, clearmake does not audit non-MVFS files
automatically (if listed explicitly in the Makefile, clearmake will
record their status). Believe it or not, you can run clearmake
under control of AO. Clearmake will ignore non-MVFS files
automatically, AO can be configured to ignore MVFS files, and
together they record <strong>all</strong> prerequisites. In this
mode there is no AO server; AO is operating in client-only mode to
generate dependency lists which are included by the Makefile.
Clearmake will see these non-MVFS dependencies and record them in
the CC database. This is easier to demo than to describe but it did
work when last tried.</p>
<h2><a id=
"use_within_dynamic_views">USE WITHIN DYNAMIC VIEWS</a></h2>
<p>You might be tempted to consider using AO instead of clearmake
even in dynamic views. AO has no problem running in a view.
However, there are problems with running datestamp-based build
tools in dynamic views due to subleties in the way CC datestamps
can interact with uncheckouts or changes in the config spec. You
just don't want to do datestamp-based work in MVFS and AO can't
change that. On the other hand, if you have a build tool which
doesn't use datestamps, AO will work fine since it is not itself
confused by datestamps.</p>
