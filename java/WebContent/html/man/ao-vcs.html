SYSTEM INTEGRATION</a></h1>
<pre>
This document discusses methods of integration between AO and version
control systems.
</pre>
<p>Fundamentally, SCM/versioning tools tend to distinguish file
states with concepts like version numbers, labels, and other
abstract, value-added metadata. By contrast - at least out of the
box - AO thinks in terms of more low-level standard metadata such
as file size, date, and checksum. There are, however, ways of
bridging the gap for any VCS which implements a <em>trigger</em>
mechanism.</p>
<p>Triggers are programs registered to be automatically run (or
&quot;fired&quot;) whenever a particular action takes place. Most
versioning tools implement triggering on at least such basic
operations as checkin and checkout. Checkin triggers are often used
to validate or test the new file, to check that a comment has been
supplied, or implement other site policies.</p>
<p>Triggers may in some cases be subdivided into pre- and post-
types. I.e. a pre-checkin trigger is run before checkin while the
post- variant would be run after.</p>
<p>The AO features which support VCS integration are the
<em>namestate</em> and <em>label</em> actions. As the name implies,
<em>namestate</em> gives a name to a particular path state. The
name can be any text string but the most obvious use would be the
VCS version, thus associating AO's checksum-based understanding
with the VCS tool's version abstraction.</p>
<p>The <em>label</em> command operates at a higher level; a label
applies to an entire PTX (aka build). Again, it can be any text
string but the most common use case would be to use the same label
which was applied to the source files prior to the build, thus
providing a tight link between sources and the deliverables derived
from them.</p>
<h2><a id=
"clearcase_checkinpost_trigger">ClearCase Checkin-Post
Trigger</a></h2>
<p>Here is an example trigger definition for ClearCase. The idea is
that each time a file is checked in, this trigger fires and sends a
record to the AO database which associates the version
(CLEARCASE_ID_STR) with the checksum of the checked-in version.
From then on, AO will always refer to that file state by its
version rather than its checksum.</p>
<pre>
    cleartool mktrtype -element -all -postop checkin\
        -c "Map version names between CC and AO"\
        -execunix 'ao namestate -p + -f $CLEARCASE_ID_STR $CLEARCASE_PN'\
        -execwin  "ao namestate -p + -f %CLEARCASE_ID_STR% %CLEARCASE_PN%"\
        ao_name_state
</pre>
<p>For SCM systems other than ClearCase the syntax will of course differ but the basic principle is the same;
you want each checkin to fire a trigger which in turn runs &quot;namestate&quot;.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: Unfortunately, the "namestate" command is not currently working and the above is on hold until it's fixed.</b></p>
