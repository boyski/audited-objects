<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.10 (Nov 9, 2011):</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Moved Java server into Git repository.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.9 (Oct 1, 2011):</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleanup pass over documentation.</li>
  <li>Switched to use of libgit2 for SHA-1 calculations, retired OpenSSL/libcrypto.</li>
  <li>Updated jar files in server.</li>
  <li>Work around Ubuntu $LIB bug by using $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to find auditor on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.8 (July 5, 2011):</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is a fairly minor release, with a couple of smaller bugfixes and some
  cleanup and streamlining of code.
  </li>
  <li>Added an <i>aoquery</i> script for digging details out of an audit file manually.</li>
  <li>Brought back Mac OS X support. The Mac binaries are "fat" in that they contain both
  32- and 64-bit code (for Intel only - no PPC support).</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.7 (March 10, 2011):</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Major textual simplification of client code: Windows-style "tchar" macros,
  which are designed to allow code to be built for single-byte or Unicode multi-byte,
  character sets, were removed. There is no likelihood of the client ever needing to be
  built for Unicode. Meanwhile this feature had not been exercised for years and
  was certainly broken, and of course it was non-obvious to Unix people and a pain to
  keep up. So, removed. Not a functional change, just a massive text edit.
  </li>
  <li>Major bugfix for Linux. Previous versions worked on 32-bit <b>or</b>
  64-bit Linux but were unable to function in an environment of mixed
  32- and 64-bit processes, which is increasingly a common situation.
  This is also known as a "multilib" installation. Anyway, I finally
  found out how to support multilib and implemented it in this release.
  Starting from 1.0.7, you can choose the 32- or 64-bit binary package but
  each package contains both 32- and 64-bit auditors; the only difference
  between them is the bit width of the "ao" driver program.
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.6:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated third-party jars (H2).</li>
  <li>Finished moving client code into Git.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.5:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Version 1.0.5 contains a major reworking of the auto-dependency generation code.
  It required changing the -M and -F flags non-compatibly but I doubt anyone was using them
  the old way since they weren't too useful. In the new model, simply adding <i>-M</i>
  (a la gcc) will cause AO to create "dependency fragments", one per target, with a .d extension.
  Adding a <i>-F foo.mk</i> flag will cause AO to also generate a wrapper makefile which
  includes all those fragments. Thus, you can either take responsibility for including the fragments
  directly in your own Makefiles, or you can create the wrapper file and include just that, possibly
  by using the GNU Make MAKEFILES environment variable. The net result is that
  "MAKEFILES=`pwd`/foo.mk ao -M -F foo.mk make" should both create and use a set of generated
  dependency files without any modification of the existing Makefiles. There are other ways; see
  the <a href="ao-howto.html">HOWTO</a> and <a href="ao-tour.html">Tour</a> documents.
  <li>The Unix auditor library has been renamed from <i>libao.so</i> to <i>libAO.so</i>. This was
  done partly for consistency with the Windows client and partly to avoid possible confusion
  with a different "libao" library (http://www.xiph.org/ao/), an audio library which was once dead
  but then resuscitated. The old libao.so file shouldn't break anything but could cause confusion
  in future so it's best to remove it manually.
  </li>
  </li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.4:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Removed the Solaris/sparc binary. This can easily be
  reconstituted if there's a call for it but for now we will save the disk space and
  build time and concentrate on more modern platforms.</li>
  <li>Now building the Linux 64-bit binary on an older system for better
  compatibility. Both 32- and 64-bit Linux versions now require glibc 2.3.2 or better.
  </li>
  <li>Updated some third-party jars to latest (EclipseLink, H2, log4j, etc).</li>
  <li>Made some minor recycling optimizations.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.3:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved aggregation properties to better handle different compiler installation styles,
  particularly for g++ and specifically to fix a problem exposed by Ubuntu packaging.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.2:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a new client binary for 64-bit Linux.</li>
  <li>Fixed some Linux incompatibilities with Ubuntu variants.</li>
  <li>Changed default project name strategy to remove any trailing "-version".</li>
  <li>Reworked clients to link with libcrypto. This was done to make it structurally
  easier to experiment with alternate identity hash algorithms (e.g. SHA1) and also
  to rely on more standard, and more regularly maintained, libraries.
  Removed the older individual libraries like libsha2 and libvmac.</li>
 <li>Upgraded the embedded DB to H2 1.2.141 (from 1.2.140).</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0.1:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced the "lsbuilds" action to search for PTXes which may have generated a specified file.</li>
  <li>Moved logfiles to a subdir called "_LOGFILES_"</li>
  <li>Persist command lines to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR to avoid overflows.</li>
  <li>Upgraded embedded DB to H2 1.2.140 (from 1.2.139).</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed some JavaDoc warnings.</li>
  <li>Changed the printing of additional license info so it works as static content.</li>
  <li>Ongoing documentation improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0 RC5:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Changed the long name of the -d flag to -d/ata-compare, and fixed its
  format to show date stamps where data codes are not available.</li>
  <li>Added a new "diff" action for comparing PTXes.</li>
  <li>Server source code cleanup to normalize case.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><hr />
<p><h5>1.0 RC4:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded third-party jar (H2).</li>
  <li>Added a new standard -d/ata-only flag for actions.</li>
  <li>Tweaked format of "ao stat" output to be consistent with "ao ls -d".</li>
  <li>Fixed wildcarding in Windows client.</li>
  <li>Client source cleanup - simplify Win32 and tchar.h porting hacks.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr />

<p><h5>1.0 RC3:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ongoing documentation improvements based on user feedback.</li>
  <li>Fixed client to handle unrecognized property settings through the
    environment more gracefully.</li>
    <li>Dialed down default logging verbosity for public consumption. Also removed appender for separate AOServer.log file.</li>
    <li>Removed overlapping strcpy from client code for POSIX conformance.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr />

<p><h5>1.0 RC2:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Functionally identical to 1.0 RC1 with updates to documentation and
    cosmetic improvements to sample Unix startup script.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<hr />

<p><h5>1.0 RC1:</h5></p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial Release Candidate</li>
</ul>
