This is a simple interposer library plus a test case. Type "make"
to build both. After doing so, there are two ways to run the "lab"
program: first we can run it with LD_PRELOAD set to insert the
library:

% LD_PRELOAD=./liblab.so ./lab
= Loading library!
= close(250)
= open(/etc/passwd, 0, 00) = 3
= close(3)
= close(251)
= Unloading library!

Note that the test program simply opens and then closes a file, and
closes a couple of random file descriptors for good measure.  Next
we can run it without LD_PRELOAD. The test case is coded such that
if LD_PRELOAD is not present it will load and unload the library
explicitly:

% ./lab                       
= Loading library!
= Unloading library!

Here we can see that the library is still mapped and unmapped but
the interposing no longer works. The goal of this project is to
make the second case behave like the first, with the exception that
the two extraneous closes should be ignored since the library is
not present at those times.
