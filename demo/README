These source packages are not part of the AO tool and are provided for
test and demo purposes only.

The 'hello' directory contains a typical "Hello World" program. This is
the simplest demo and generally should be tried first. It is provided
with both a Makefile and a build.sh script for Unix build purposes, and
a NMakefile (e.g. "nmake -f NMakefile") and a build.bat script for
Windows. Any of these build models may be used with AO; in fact that is
the point of this demo.

Other source packages are simply downloaded open-source tools which are
known to work well with AO. They should be unpacked and built in the
standard, documented manner and then built with AO. Generally these can
be built on Unix via "sh configure && make clean all". On Windows this
is often trickier but a "build.bat" script may have been supplied.
