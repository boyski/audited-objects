<h1 style="text-align:center;">AO Developer Notes</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">This is a random collection of notes written for
developers working on AO internals, not for users.</p>
<h2><a>Building AO</a></h2>
<p>The AO client is versioned in Git at sourceforge.net. To grab a read-only
clone use the following command:
</p>
<code>git clone git://audited-objects.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/audited-objects/audited-objects</code>

<p>and for a person with commit privileges:</p>

<code>git clone ssh://USERNAME@audited-objects.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/audited-objects/audited-objects</code>

<h2><a id="abstractions">Abstractions</a></h2>
<p>Let's start with a short overview of the basic AO coding abstractions (the
same basic model is in use on both client and server sides, though
many details differ).</p>

<p>AO is concerned with software builds. A build is
basically a deterministic ordered sequence of commands operating on
files. At its simplest level, AO keeps track of which
files were opened by which commands along with their exact state at
time of open. Thus it's not surprising that the three fundamental AO
concepts are <i>Builds</i>, <i>Commands</i>, and
<i>Files</i>. These abstractions are broken into classes as
follows:</p>

<p>A <i>Command</i> object represents a command line which could
be executed at any time, while a <i>CommandAction</i> represents
a single execution of a given <i>Command</i>. In other words the
relationship between a <i>Command</i> and a
<i>CommandAction</i> is analogous to that between a class and an
instance of that class. In real-life
terms this means that &quot;gcc -c foo.c&quot; is a Command, which is
inherently singular; if the command is run multiple times, a new
CommandAction object will be generated each time but they will all
share the same Command object.</p>

<p>Files are slightly more complicated. At the lowest level we have
a <i>PathName</i> object which represents a <i>potential</i> file.
Think of a <i>PathName</i> as an <i>abstract file</i> which may
or may not exist at any given time, and whose contents may vary
when it does exist. A <i>PathState</i> contains a
<i>PathName</i> and represents one actual version of that file;
it describes a particular file state involving size, date stamp,
checksum, etc. A <i>PathAction</i> contains a <i>PathState</i>
and represents an actual <i>use</i> of that version. In other
words every successful <code>open()</code> system call results in a
new <i>PathAction</i>.</p>

<p>There can be many <i>PathAction</i>s per <i>PathState</i>
since a file may be read many times without being changed. However,
when the action is a write it's likely to change the file's state so
for writes the relationship between <i>PathAction</i>s and
<i>PathState</i>s becomes more like one-to-one.</p>
<p>We can say that CommandActions contain Commands in the same way
that PathActions contain PathStates.</p>
<p>It's important to note here that AO sees files differently from
the way the filesystem sees them. To AO, if you rename &quot;foo&quot; to
&quot;bar&quot; you've destroyed one file and created another. To the
filesystem there was only one file which remained unchanged while the
parent directory was modified.</p>
<p>Now let's switch and look from the top down. The highest-level
abstraction in AO is a collection of files called a
<i>Project</i>. This is very likely to map to what you already
think of as a project. For instance, IDEs such as Eclipse and
Visual Studio break code into projects, and the AO project would
typically comprise the same file set. Fundamentally, an AO
<i>Project</i> is a coherent code base sharing a common parent
directory and which builds as a unit.</p>

<p>A <i>Project</i> object will contain a set of Builds, although
for historical reasons a Build is called a <i>PTX</i> or Project
Transaction instead. A <i>PTX</i> contains an ordered list of
<i>CommandAction</i>s, and each <i>CommandAction</i> contains a
<i>Command</i> and a set of <i>PathAction</i>s. These concepts
are as described above.</p>

<p>To tie it all together, consider a single AO
<i>Project</i>. Each build you do within this project under AO
control generates a new <i>PTX</i> object which contains a
sequence of <i>CommandAction</i> objects. Each
<i>CommandAction</i> contains a <i>Command</i> plus a set of
<i>PathAction</i> objects. <i>PathActions</i> contain references
to <i>PathStates</i> which in turn have references to
<i>PathNames</i>. These <i>PathActions</i> are categorized as
<i>prerequisites</i> or <i>targets</i> depending on whether
they represent a read or a write action.</p>

<p>Please take note of a subtlety: AO pays no attention to the
<i>current working directory</i>. This is because not all
commands are sensitive to CWD; a command such as &quot;/bin/gcc -c -o
~/src/foo.o ~/src/foo.c&quot; will produce exactly the same output
regardless of CWD. Since it's impossible to determine textually
whether a given command cares about CWD, AO ignores it and looks
for better ways to distinguish commands. Thus a particular Command
object is treated the same regardless of where it is run.</p>

<h2><a id="client_vs_server">CLIENT VS SERVER</a></h2>
<p>Though the AO client is written in C and the server in Java, and
they have no code in common, both sides employ the same basic
abstractions of Project, PTX, Command/CommandAction, and
PathName/PathState/PathAction. There is wide variance in details,
because some methods and attributes are of use only to one or the
other, but the concepts are the same.</p>

<h2><a id="character_sets">CHARACTER SETS</a></h2>
<p>The auditor always uses 8-bit character widths and UTF-8
for both internal representations and transmission over HTTP.
