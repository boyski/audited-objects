<h2>AO SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>Audited Objects (AO) is a tool for the analysis and optimization
of automated software processes such as builds <a href=
"#footnote1">[1]</a>. When a build process is run under AO control,
each command executed is recorded in a central database along with
a record of each file opened by that command and its state
(checksum/size/timestamp) as of that instant. A full copy of each
<em>modified</em> file is stored in the database as well.</p>
<p>AO also provides a suite of tools for analyzing this data once
collected. There are many uses for this
information, including but not limited to:</p>

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#dependency_generation">Generating a &quot;perfect&quot;
set of dependency information for existing Makefiles, thus enabling safe parallel builds.</a></h4>

Most make-based build systems are unreliable because they don't
fully capture all prerequisites. Even <a href="http://mad-scientist.net/make/autodep.html">dependency
generators</a> such as <i>makedepend</i> generally address only compilation steps and cannot account
for changes in libraries and utilities, not to mention tasks other than compilation and linking or
compiling unusual languages. The
result is that most Makefiles aren't trusted to run in parallel because they aren't &quot;thread-safe&quot;.
Having a <i>complete</i> map of which files depend on which
can go a long way towards making a build robust enough that incremental and parallel builds
are trusted as a matter of course.

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#regenerating_makefiles">Regenerating a clean, correct new
Makefile (or other format) from a creaky old build system.</a></h4>

Upgrading or replacing an existing build system is a dark art, and the
risk of breaking something usually makes people hesitant to do anything aggressive. But since
AO has access to the complete set of targets, prerequisites, and
command lines, it can generate a new Makefile known to be
correct and complete from a record of the old build (and generating any other format is a simple
matter of scripting). As with most code generators there are
certain things it doesn't do well - pattern rules, for instance,
and alternate build styles such as debug, profiled, etc. These can
often be added manually, however, and thus AO can be quite helpful
in replacing a shaky old build system with a reliable new one.

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#comparing_build_servers">Qualifying a new build server by showing it to be functionally
identical to the current one.</a></h4>

Replacing a slow old build server with a faster new one can be
scary because it's hard to be sure they're identically configured.
AO can list the differences, right down to OS patches. Once it says
both are running the same commands in the same order on the same
set of input files, you can be sure they'll produce the same
outputs.

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#finding_old_build">Determining which build generated a particular file
for the purpose of making a patch.</a></h4>

It's common practice to lay an SCM label across all versioned files
for each release. But that doesn't mean that, two years later, you
can find a machine where you know the compiler is the same and the
OS is patched to the same level. AO can alert you to these
differences.

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#build_avoidance">Speeding up builds by copying in files built by other team
members from identical input conditions.</a></h4>

Since build processes are by definition deterministic, it follows
that multiple invocations of the same command on the same set of
input files will produce identical output files. Therefore, since
AO (optionally) stores all generated files in its database, it can
step in when it sees that a user is about to build a file it
already has and silently skip the redundant command, copying in the
existing output files instead. This is called recycling and it can
speed up builds significantly.

<h4><a href="man/ao-howto.html#listing_source_files">Determining the exact set of source files needed for a build,
to avoid having to extract an entire subtree.</a></h4>

Most builds begin by extracting or refreshing the required set of
files from source control. The typical strategy is to grab all
files under a particular subdirectory, recursively. But this may
include thousands of files (documentation, images, etc) which are
not needed at build time, and this can be a significant drag on
round trip build time. Since AO knows the complete list of which
files will be used, it's easy to script up something which will
grab only those.

<em>Although the most common use case may be software builds,
AO works with any process which is both deterministic and file-based
(meaning that both input and output consist of file data).
Basically, if a process can be usefully automated it can be
usefully audited with AO.</em>
