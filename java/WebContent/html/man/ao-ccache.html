<h1 style="text-align:center;"><a id="ao_compared_with_ccache">AO COMPARED
WITH CCACHE</a></h1>

<p>This document informally compares and contrasts AO with the open source tool
called <a href="http://ccache.samba.org">ccache</a>.</p>

<p>Although "CCACHE" is not an acronym, we sometimes use the upper-case form for
lexicographic consistency.</p>
<hr />

<h2><a id="how_ccache_works">HOW CCACHE WORKS</a></h2>

<p>There's no need to explain ccache in detail here since its <a
href="http://ccache.samba.org">own website</a> does a fine job. Here's the
top-level summary from that website:</p>

<p><i>
&quot;ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation of C/C++ code by caching
previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again.
This often results in a significant speedup in common compilations.&quot;
</i></p>

<p>Note that for simplicity we sometimes refer to ccache as a C compiler
speedup when it really supports a suite of C-like languages such as C++,
Objective-C, and Objective-C++.</p>
<hr />

<h2><a id="executive_summary">EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY</a></h2>

<p>Conceptually, ccache is remarkably simple; it's just a fast C compiler.
Imagine that some genius rewrote GCC to be half a dozen times faster; it would
be a tremendous boon to anyone compiling C code and of absolutely no interest
to anyone else. That's the ccache story in a nutshell. On the other hand AO
maintains a language-independent, shared database of <i>reuse
opportunities</i>, along with a suite of other features.</p>

<p>Thus, CCACHE and AO are not <em>directly</em> competitive; AO is a strict
superset of ccache. If a user needs only the features provided by ccache, it's
probably the better choice due to its simplicity. If the user needs some of the
additional features listed below, AO would be the only answer.</p>
<hr />

<h2><a id="ao_vs_ccache">AO vs CCACHE</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_works_with_tools_other_than_c_compilers">AO works with tools
    other than C compilers</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>Because it depends on running the C preprocessor, ccache can only work
    with C code. AO operates at a much lower level, neither knowing nor caring
    about the language. It knows only about file-oriented system calls such as
    open, close, and rename.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ccache_is_personal_and_local">CCACHE is personal and
    local</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>CCACHE is a personal tool; it keeps its cache in the user's home
    directory. Thus each user must build up and maintain his/her cache without
    sharing. In fact a user can only share with him/herself on different
    machines to the degree that the home directory is shared via a network file
    system. Although this is a common model within a LAN, it is far less common
    across any distance. One result of this is that if a global header file
    changes such that a full rebuild is required, each user must do that
    rebuild to update their cache.
    <i>Update: this is apparently no longer true if it ever was, since the
    ccache website says nowadays "You can also share the cache between users".
    I do not know how recent or robust this is.</i>
    AO keeps all data, including file versions, in a central database
    location. Though it records the author of each build for metrics purposes,
    it doesn't particularly care who contributed the files. Thus all users
    contribute to, and benefit from, a shared pool. One effect of the shared
    cache is that AO is well adapted to use across a WAN. While the laws of
    physics regarding bandwidth cannot be repealed, AO makes little demand on
    latency because it is designed to require very few round trips. So as long
    as the link is fast enough to carry the files, AO should work fine over
    distance though you though you might want to consider <em>selfish mode</em>
    (vide infra).</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_has__22selfish_22_and__22martyr_22_modes">AO has "selfish" and
    "martyr" modes</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>A user may choose to be <em>selfish</em>, meaning they will be happy to
    take from the cache but prefer not to contribute to it. This may make
    sense, for instance, over a slow or asymmetric (such as a cable modem)
    network link where the cost of uploading files could become prohibitive.
    There's also a give-without-receiving or <em>martyr</em> mode which may be
    preferred for nightly builds that run when CPU cycles are free. The nightly
    build can thus test that from-scratch builds continue to work while
    altruistically generating objects which selfish developers can use during
    the day. <i>Update - it appears that ccache has analogues here -
    CCACHE_READONLY is selfish and CCACHE_RECACHE is altruistic.</i></p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ccache_helps_with_compilation_but_not_linking">CCACHE helps with
    compilation but not linking</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>According to the blurb above, CCACHE typically provides a 5-10 times
    speedup. AO has been observed to speed up some builds by much more.
    Presumably, at least part of the difference comes from the fact that AO can
    cache and replay the linking phase (as well as any other tools run by the
    build) while ccache optimizes only C compilations.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_has_analysis_capability">AO has analysis
    capability</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>CCACHE is strictly a compiler optimizer; it makes a binary go/no go
    decision as to whether a cached result is still valid. However, it cannot
    tell you why a given cached result is invalid or, more generally, what has
    changed between two builds. AO can do those things. If you think you should
    be getting reuse but aren't, you can ask it what went wrong. This will
    normally point to a structural problem which can be fixed. Thus AO can help
    fix the build model to be safer/cleaner/more portable in ways which apply
    even to unaudited builds.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_can__22qualify_22_a_new_build_system">AO can "qualify" a new
    build system</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>Rolling out a new build machine can be stressful; what if it has a
    slightly different set of patches or service packs, resulting in different
    binaries? Even worse is adding a new machine to a build pool, because that
    can result in binaries which differ depending on which machine they happen
    to have been built on. AO can solve this problem by spitting out a list of
    all involved system files with checksums. If the checksums on the new
    machine match, it's ready. If not, you know exactly where the problem
  lies.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_offers_centralized_2c_database_2dquality_persis">AO offers
    centralized, database-quality persistence</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>The AO "cache" is kept in one place on a server where it can be backed up
    and potentially provide a query-able history going back years, with all
    released binaries suitably labeled and correlated with the source files
    from which they were derived. CCACHE leaves an inscrutably-named set of files
    spread across home directories. <i>Of course it would be just as fair to turn that
    spin around and say that ccache relies on an elegant, simple structure of flat files
    whereas AO requires a highly complex object model and relational database :-).</i></p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_can_infer_prerequisites_and_feed_them_back_to_a">AO can infer
    prerequisites and feed them back to a Makefile</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>AO builds up a database containing a record of precisely which files were
    opened in the course of creating which other files. It's trivial to dump
    this data back out in Makefile syntax. By including a file containing that
    output into the original Makefile, you can assure yourself of having
    absolutely complete dependency information.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_can_make_parallel_builds_more_robust">AO can make parallel
    builds more robust</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>Race conditions are the great enemy of all parallelism. In the context of
    builds, race conditions are the result of having inadequate dependency
    information. With AO providing complete dependencies, parallel builds are
    much less likely to go wrong.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_can_integrate_into_an_scm_system">AO can integrate into an SCM
    system</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>AO contains hooks allowing it to be integrated with source code
    management or versioning tools. There are two main benefits to such
    integration: first, instead of knowing only that foo.o depends on the
    version of foo.c with a checksum of such-and-such, we can map checksums to
    versions and know that we used foo.c version so-and-so. Second, AO can put
    arbitrary labels on the generated binaries (actually on their representations
    in the database). Typically you'd use the same label that was placed on the
    source files, resulting in a fully-labeled build.</p>
  <li><strong><a id="item_distributed_parallelism">Distributed Parallelism</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>This one is currently an advantage for ccache. Although AO was designed
    with distributed builds in mind, actual support for this feature is still
    on the todo list. Meanwhile ccache has a functioning, stable, well-known
    partner tool <a href="http://distcc.org">DISTCC</a> which distributes C
    compilations.</p>
  <li><strong><a     id="item_constant_overhead">Constant Overhead</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <p>AO imposes a certain overhead on commands which it actually runs (as
    opposed to replaying). A typical penalty for the initial build of a piece
    of software might be 10%, though it is sometimes more and often
    much less. CCACHE has overhead too, of course, but its overhead
    appears to be significantly less.</p>
  <li><strong><a     id="ccache_is_mature">CCACHE is Mature, AO is Young</a></strong><br />
  </li>
    <p>This pretty much speaks for itself, but is also subject to change. 
    </p>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2><a id="deep_thoughts">DEEP THOUGHTS</a></h2>

<p>In summary, it's worth thinking about <em>why</em> and <em>when</em> ccache
is useful. It's not useful the first time you do a build, nor when many source
files have changed. As its website says:</p>

<pre>    If you ever run "make clean; make" then you can probably benefit from ccache.</pre>

<p>CCACHE is only useful when building objects you <em>already have</em>. And why
would someone want to rebuild something they already have? Most commonly
because they don't fully trust their build system and only feel safe with a
clean build from scratch.</p>

<p>So why don't people trust their build system? Because it doesn't fully
capture the dependency graph. Since Makefiles (and similar) tend to require
hand-coded prerequisite data it's rare for them to be completely and
demonstrably correct. Using a "makedepend" system gets closer to correctness
without reaching it, because those tools cannot parse every possible syntax and
must make assumptions about conditionals and paths which may not be true during
the actual build.</p>

<p>AO may be able to speed up the "make clean; make" pattern somewhat more than ccache can. More
notably, though, it can make that pattern less useful in the first place by
feeding demonstrably correct and complete prerequisite data back to the build
tool.</p>

<p>Thus, in a perfect world ccache would be unnecessary while AO would still
offer the benefits above (not that a perfect world is expected any time
soon).</p>
<hr />

<h2><a id="actual_timings">ACTUAL TIMINGS</a></h2>

<p>Here are some real-life timing comparisons from a slow system (ccache=2.4, AO=1.0):</p>
<pre>        <b>bash 3.2</b>:
        
        Baseline                250 wallclock seconds
        CCACHE first pass       331 wallclock seconds
        CCACHE second pass       85 wallclock seconds
        AO first pass           282 wallclock seconds
        AO second pass           27 wallclock seconds</pre>

<p></p>
<pre>        <b>jikes 1.22</b>:
        
        Baseline                847 wallclock seconds
        CCACHE first pass       869 wallclock seconds
        CCACHE second pass       50 wallclock seconds
        AO first pass           877 wallclock seconds
        AO second pass            9 wallclock seconds</pre>

<p>Both AO and CCACHE perform better with jikes than bash (this is primarily
because jikes is C++ code, and C++ compilers are much slower than C compilers),
but AO outperforms CCACHE on both benchmarks once the cache is warm.
However, this may not mean as much in real life since most of the additional
AO speedup is in link time, and the hit rate for reuse is often much less for links.
If link steps can't be elided then performance is more likely to even out.
CCACHE has its own <a href="http://ccache.samba.org/performance.html">performance metrics</a>
which may be of interest here.</p>
