INTEGRATION</a></h1>
<p>
This document discusses methods of integration between AO and
<a href="http://www.jazz.net">Rational Team Concert</a>, or RTC.
</p>
<p>It may become important to have some form of integration between
AO and Rational Team Concert. This can mean many things and would
probably lead to a number of subsidiary work items in the end; this
work item is a general-purpose place holder. It's not clear yet how
important an integration is, nor to what degree an integration
could be generalized to other SCM and build environments.</p>
<p>Begin with the observation that the server side of RTC is a
standard web application (Jazz.war) running under Tomcat (or
WebSphere) and persisting to a small list of supported databases
(Derby, DB2, Oracle, SQL Server). AO is another standard web
application (AO.war) running under Tomcat (has also been tested
under JBoss and GlassFish, would very likely work with WebSphere)
and using JPA 2.0 as its persistence API. JPA 2 will easily support
all RTC databases as well as many others.</p>
<p>There are a number of potential levels and types of
integrations. From least integrated to most:</p>
<ul>
<li><a id="item_9080">Sharing a container.
Simply sticking AO.war into the same directory as Jazz.war allows
them to share the same container. This has been tested and shown to
work with Tomcat; just copy AO.war to
/opt/jazz/server/tomcat/webapps and address it on port 9080
(default HTTP port for Jazz) and it works. There is no data
interchange; neither one knows about the other, but there are
significant advantages to sharing a container and physical
hardware: one will never be running without the other, stopping the
container would put them both in a quiescent state and allow them
to be backed up together, they can share the same disk partition,
etc.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id=
"item_running_jbe_builds_under_control_of_the_ao_client_" id=
"item_running_jbe_builds_under_control_of_the_ao_client_">Running
JBE builds under control of the AO client. This has also been
tested and found workable. It currently requires the build to be of
the Command Line type so that &quot;ao run&quot; can be prepended to the
command line. I.e. an Ant build can't use AO with the built-in Ant
support; it has to fork a new process starting with &quot;ao run ant
...&quot;. Still works fine but a little more setup work. If the build
was Command Line in the first place, it's as simple as adding the
&quot;ao run&quot; to the command line. This still has data silos - AO data
in the AO DB, Jazz in the Jazz DB.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id="item_jbe">A potential
enhancement to the above would be the ability to import auditing
capability into the current process rather than injecting it into a
new one. This would allow the JBE (as well as Visual Studio or any
other IDE) to load the auditing library into its JVM process, run a
build within that process, and unload the library. This would in
turn enable, for instance, the built-in Ant support to be used and
would make the whole integration more seamless though it would not
actually add new capabilities. Note that there's an alternate
version of this in which the entire IDE or server is run under AO
control in a mode where auditing is turned off (in other words
function calls are still intercepted but just passed along
untouched). Then, on receipt of a message of some kind full
auditing is enabled until the build is done. This is partially
implemented under the name IDE Mode or
Activation.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id="item_control">Sharing data
with the Jazz server and database. In other words, via supported
APIs we would hook into terms like Jazz &quot;baselines&quot; and
&quot;snapshots&quot; such that a build could record not only the versions
of contributing files under Jazz SCM control (which it does
natively) but also system files and files managed in other SCM
tools such as SVN or ClearCase. This is probably what most people
would think of as &quot;integration&quot;.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id="item_services">Using Jazz
Storage Services (name??) for files. Jazz exposes an API for
holding BLOBs. AO could potentially use that API to store file
containers rather than going it alone.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id="item_eclipse">Eclipse
(client side) integration. A perspective or view allowing
post-mortem navigation and maintenance of builds. Basically the
equivalent of the AO user actions implemented in an Eclipse view.
This would presumably be an offshoot of the web GUI work (in fact a
cheap solution would be to use the built-in Eclipse browser for
this). This would include report generation (BIRT?), build
maintenance (labeling, cleanup of old builds), charting,
etc.</a><br /></li>
<li><a id=
"item_full_database_integration_2e_conceivably_there_wou">Full
database integration. Conceivably there would be a way to extend
the schema dynamically such that all AO data could live in the same
database as Jazz data and be queryable via standard Jazz APIs. I
believe this is prohibited for third-party integrations and thus
not an option. Listed only for
completeness.</a><br /></li>
