<h2 style="text-align:center;"><a id="tuning_make_for_ao">Tuning Make For AO</a></h2>
<p>This is a set of informal notes on things you may consider doing
to optimize your <i>make-based</i> build for AO.</p>

<h2><a id="conventions">Conventions</a></h2>
<p>Examples given here will tend to be Linux- and
bash-centric. The concepts, however, are directly
applicable (except where noted) to other (Windows, csh, etc)
environments.</p>
<p>It's assumed that you are at least somewhat
familiar with the operation of the standard <em>make</em> utility.
</p>

<h2><a id="combining_scripts">Combining Script Lines</a></h2>
<p>Probably the most important tip is to put related operations
under control of a single <i>aggregated</i> master process. Consider the
following simple Makefile:</p>
<pre>
    foo:
            gen_data &gt; tmp_foo
            mv -f tmp_foo foo
</pre>
<p>This is a very common idiom: build a file under a temporary
name (<code>tmp_foo</code>) and move it to its final location
only when done. There's nothing wrong with this method per se, but
complications arise when it's handled in two separate lines as above.
Typically <em>make</em> will implement them as two unrelated processes.
In other words Make will generally take the first line above and
pass it to the shell, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
    /bin/sh -c "gen_data &gt; tmp_foo"
</pre>
<p>Then, assuming the command returned successfully, it will do the
same with the second line:</p>
<pre>
    /bin/sh -c "mv -f tmp_foo foo"
</pre>

<p>It's important to remember here that AO audits
<strong>processes</strong>. Each process - along with any
subprocesses with which it might be aggregated - is treated as a &quot;black
box&quot; or <em>audit unit</em>. Thus while from <em>make's</em>
perspective these lines form a single logically-coherent <em>build
script</em> AKA <em>recipe</em>, to AO they are two different <em>audit units</em>.
In other words,<i>make</i> knows that these lines are part of the
same recipe but AO has no way to find that out because it doesn't
read makefile syntax.</p>

<p>As a result, the first line will result in a file called
<code>tmp_foo</code> being recorded as a target. The second will
record the fact that <code>tmp_foo</code> was renamed. This is not
wrong but it is sub-optimal. On a subsequent recycling build
these actions will be played back correctly but inefficiently,
because (a) the <em>mv</em> operation must be run and (b) what the
database records is different from our intuitive understanding of
what was really done and why. Even worse, if the recipe ended by
removing <code>tmp_foo</code>, a recycling build would save a copy
of it and download it only to remove it immediately. And if a new makefile
is generated from this data it will have <code>tmp_foo</code> as a
target. Ideally we'd prefer AO to understand that this is an atomic
sequence producing only <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>Ironically, the problem would be worse if the code was better:</p>
<pre>
    foo:
            gen_data &gt; tmp_foo.$$$$
            mv -f tmp_foo.$$$$ foo
</pre>        
<p>The temp file is now uniqified by adding a pid, which is more robust, but
this will simply cause uniquely-named files to pile up in the AO database.</p>

<p>Though these are not show-stopper problems, they slow down the audit,
add noise to the database, and obfuscate our view of what's really taking
place. Fortunately they can all be fixed by a slight modification of
the build script:</p>

<pre>
    foo:
            gen_data &gt; tmp_foo &amp;&amp;\
            mv -f tmp_foo foo
</pre>

<p>Here we've combined the two commands to run under a single shell
process. Not only is this cleaner and more efficient when using AO,
it's cleaner and more efficient <em>when not using AO</em> too;
it's just a better way to do things. In fact, consider this
paragraph from the RATIONALE section of the POSIX <em>make</em>
document:</p>

<pre>
    The default in some advanced versions of make is to group all the
    command lines for a target and execute them using a single shell
    invocation; the System V method is to pass each line individually
    to a separate shell. The single-shell method has the advantages in
    performance and the lack of a requirement for many continued
    lines.  However, converting to this newer method has caused
    portability problems with many historical makefiles, so the
    behavior with the POSIX makefile is specified to be the same as
    that of System V. It is suggested that the special target .ONESHELL
    be used as an implementation extension to achieve the single-shell
    grouping for a target or group of targets.
</pre>

<p>Here, POSIX is acknowledging that having <em>make</em> run the
entire build script under control of a single shell process would
have been a better design but accepts that it's too late to change
the default, while recommending a way to get the more efficient
behavior. With luck your make program may actually support
<em>.ONESHELL</em>. If not, you can achieve the same result by
combining logically related commands manually as shown above
and end up with a better Makefile anyway.</p>

<p>The AO-specific advantage of combining scripts is that it can
audit a create-and-rename as a single unit. AO can then determine
that <code>tmp_foo</code> was just an intermediate file and choose
not to record it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common example of this pattern is something
like:</p>
<pre>
    foo.o: foo.c
            @rm -f $@
            $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $@
</pre>
<p>This <em>build script</em> wants to make sure the old object is
out of the way before creating the new one. Combining these two
commands into one shell invocation can speed up the build
measurably. This requires only the addition of 4 characters:</p>
<pre>
    foo.o: foo.c
            @rm -f $@ &amp;&amp;\
            $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $@
</pre>
<p>Here's another, more pernicious variation on the same theme:</p>
<pre>
    foo:
        echo "first line"   &gt; foo
        echo "second line" &gt;&gt; foo
        echo "third line"  &gt;&gt; foo
        echo "fourth line" &gt;&gt; foo
</pre>
<p>There are many builds which create entire source files
incrementally in this fashion (the GCC build is one). Again, AO can
handle this but not optimally. It will see that a one-line file
<code>foo</code> was created and will upload it. It will then
record and upload the two-line version of <code>foo</code> and so
on. When recycling it will go get the one-line version, then the
two-line version, etc. The result will be correct but each
intermediate file must pass over the network only to be replaced as
soon as it arrives. This can be solved by joining lines as above,
or you could move the logic into a separate script and aggregate on
that, e.g.</p>
<pre>
    foo:
                script_to_generate_foo
</pre>
<p>while adding <code>/script_to_generate_foo/</code> to the aggregation
pattern.</p>

<p>As long as all the file appends take place under control of
<em>one</em> shell process AO will be able to record an atomic
creation of <code>foo</code> in its final form. As noted above,
this is almost always a better design anyway. Most <em>make</em>
experts would say that long scripts don't belong in Makefiles,
though open-source projects, where Makefile are often generated by
a configure script, may be granted an exemption.</p>
<p>In summary: (1) combine related shell processes into a single
shell process and (2) make sure the aggregation patterns match it
as an atomic audit unit.</p>

<h2><a id="use__oneshell__with_gnu_make_3_82_">Use .ONESHELL: with GNU Make
3.82+</a></h2>

<p>It should be noted that support for the .ONESHELL pseudo-target
mentioned above is present in GNU Make 3.82 and above. So if your
make program doesn't already support .ONESHELL, consider upgrading
to GNU Make version 3.82+.</p>
<p>In fact .ONESHELL mode is so important to AO that it contains
code to automatically turn it on for GNU make in a way that's silently
ignored by older GNU make and non-GNU make versions.
Therefore, you should not <i>need</i> to do anything to get .ONESHELL
behavior when using AO with GNU Make 3.82+.
However, it's a good idea to always embed the .ONESHELL special
target literally in new Makefiles anyway - whether you have 3.82+
or not - for consistency. It will be silently ignored by any <i>make</i>
which doesn't support it, and it's a generally better style.
</p>

<h2><a>Generating Makefiles</a></h2>
<p>AO can be used to generate Makefile data in one of two
different ways. The first is to spit out dependency files, similar to what
<i>makedepend</i> or <i>gcc -MD</i> would create. The second is to generate an
entire new and complete Makefile as a way to bootstrap yourself out of a broken
build system. These are treated separately below.
</p>
<p>Before going on it's important to understand that the tool that generates
make data is a standalone Perl script called <i>ao2make</i> which reads
the audit format of AO and converts it to make syntax. Although there is some convenience
machinery to run both processes together, not all ao2make options are exposed this way
so for advanced uses it may make more sense for the AO client to write its output to
an intermediate file from which ao2make can then read. This also means that improvements
to make-data-generation are relatively easy as it requires "only" Perl skills.
</p>
<h3>Auto-Dependency Generation</h3>
<p>This is designed to be as easy as possible since it's the most lightweight use of AO.
It makes no use of the AO server and requires only the client install. Running your
under control of the AO client with the -MD flag will cause it to generate
a <code>targetfile.d</code> file for every <code>targetfile</code>:
</p>
<pre>

    % ao -MD make ...

</pre>
<p>This presupposes that you do NOT have a server set up and configured. If you do, and in
particular if the client has a <i>Server</i> property set, then you may want to add a <code>-o@</code>
flag to suppress server interaction. There is no incompatibility between makefile generation and
server interaction; you may talk to the server for recycling opportunities AND generate prereqs at
the same time, but it may be easier to get started with one or the other.
</p>
<p> As a convenience, if you add the --make-file flag to the above:
</p>
<pre>

    % ao -MD --make-file Prereqs.mk make ...

</pre>
<p>the named file will be created with an include statement for each .d file.
</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Generating New Makefiles From Old</h3>
<p>
This will be demonstrated using the two-stage process described above. First, we do a
full build using the old Makefile and save the audit output to Foo.ao:
</p>
<pre>

    % make clean
    % ao -o Foo.ao make ...

</pre>
<p>
It's important that this be a full build so that all targets and prereqs are represented
in the .ao file. Now we can generate a Makefile from the audit data:
</p>
<pre>

    % ao2make -MF Makefile.new -full -pdump Foo.ao

</pre>
<p>This will read Foo.ao and generate Makefile.new. If things go well you should be able
to use it right away:
</p>
<pre>

    % make -f Makefile.new clean
    % make -f Makefile.new

</pre>
<p>The generated Makefile is written for GNU Make. Since it contains full dependency info, it
should be "parallel-safe" which you can test with -j4 or so.
</p>
<p>It's impossible to generate a Makefile as good as what a human can write. For instance, a human
can use pattern rules to avoid repetition, and can insert mechanisms to support alternate build types
(debug, profiled, etc) and platforms. However, very often a build system gets so mature that it's
hard to improve it gradually, and impossible to rebuild from scratch. AO can generate a clean, working,
non-recursive, parallel-safe Makefile which can then be fine tuned by hand.
