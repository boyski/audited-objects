DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS</a></h1>
<p>AO is easily added to a traditional command-line build by simply
prepending &quot;ao run&quot; to the command line. But what about
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with a graphical
<strong>Build</strong> button? Depending on the IDE there are a few
possible answers.</p>
<h2><a id="tweak_config_file">TWEAK CONFIG
FILE</a></h2>
<p>Some IDEs may have a config file or registry entry which
specifies the command to run when the <strong>Build</strong> is
pressed. These should be easy; change it to prepend the <em>ao</em>
command. There's no need to add flags here; since all options to
<em>ao</em> simply set property values, any <em>ao</em>
configuration can be done via property files.</p>
<h2><a id="ide_mode">IDE MODE</a></h2>
<p>However, some IDEs may not make such a setting available. For
these, there is an experimental, speculative <code>IDE mode</code>.
Here, the entire IDE is run under <em>ao</em> control and a special
property is set which specifies a regular expression. AO inhabits
the IDE like a beneficial virus, doing nothing but monitoring
sub-process creation. When the IDE spawns a command which matches
the regular expression, however, AO springs into action and audits
just that process subtree. This work is experimental and
undocumented; contact us if you'd like to help test it.</p>
<h2><a id="sol">S.O.L. MODE</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, some IDEs may start the build without an
accompanying new process. For instance, the <em>make</em> algorithm
is simple enough and well enough known that the IDE may choose to
<code>inline</code> its own dependency tree walker. Compile and
link operations will almost always be in a separate process space
but the control process may be within the IDE. This situation has
not yet been addressed; if and when it is encountered we may look
into a solution.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h1>
<p>No IDE has yet been tested with AO, and each IDE is different.
The above are ideas which may pay off with certain IDEs. There is
little doubt that some IDEs will be a challenge to integrate, or
that others will expose AO bugs. Improvement is ongoing.</p>
