Generate Makefile syntax from AO audit data.

This script can generate make-format dependency data, or even a full working
makefile, from the output of the AO auditing tool. By default it will
create a set of *target.d* files, one for each target. In the case of
sibling groups it will guess at a *primary* target and use that for the
name of the prereq file.

With the *--output* flag it will *also* produce a wrapper Makefile
which includes all the prereq files. If *--full* is added,
the generated file will be a full, self-contained Makefile
which inlines the prereq data and adds build commands aka "recipes".

It can be used in a few ways:

=over 4

**DEPENDENCY DATA**

The simplest use is to add full prerequisite information to an
existing, handcrafted Makefile suite. Simply add an *include*
statement to the Makefile and use this to generate the include
file. Now the Makefile will have full knowledge of which files
depend on which other files, making the build more reliable and
also opening the way to parallel builds, since generally the
problems of parallelism are solved by full dependency information.
This mode has no required flags, though you can change the file
extension with *--extension* and may need *--base* with recursive
build models.

**COMPLETE MAKEFILE**

A more ambitious use is to generate a full, working Makefile from
an old-style build. If the old build model is creaky and unreliable
and/or recursive, this can be used to generate a single, flat
Makefile with full prerequisite data as above. After some
massaging, the new Makefile may be able to replace the old, and
thus this can be used as an automated way to update old build
tooling. Use *--full* and optionally *--pdump* or *--vars*.

The structural, unavoidable problem with full makefile generation is
that we can only recapitulate the path that was taken. A real-life
makefile will often have many conditionals for platform, for debug
vs release, etc.  and the regenerated makefile will lose the unused
portions. Similarly, it will lose comments, include-file structures,
and variable (aka macro) abstractions.  And clever GNU make syntax using
functions like $(foreach ...), $(eval ...), etc. cannot be preserved.
This is all analogous to C code (generated and disassembled); some
things are just lost in translation.

**OTHER FORMATS**

This script could be modified to generate any other format. The majority
of the code simply reads audit data into data structures; this data can
be modified and dumped in any format, limited only by your coding skills.

EXAMPLES:

    %(prog)s -o Makefile audit-file

    %(prog)s -o Makefile --full --pdump < audit-file
