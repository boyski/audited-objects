BASICS OF AUDITED OBJECTS</a></h1>
<p>This document shows how a simple Hello World project can be
built under AO control and how to extract metadata derived by it.
It assumes you have already followed the installation procedures
detailed in the <em>ao-install</em> document and that the server is
running.</p>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<p>Within the AO package is a sub-package called
<a href="../../demo/demo.tar.gz">demo.tar.gz</a>.
Extract that to a location of your choice[*],
resulting in a new directory called <em>demo</em>. Under that is
another directory called <em>hello</em> which contains a tiny
&quot;hello world&quot; application. In a shell prompt, cd into this directory.</p>
<p>[*] <b>But not under /tmp or /var/tmp! Since AO contains code
to ignore temp files, it will not function correctly when the
project itself is located in a temp directory (defined to be any
path containing the string &quot;/tmp/&quot;).</b></p>
<h2><a id=
"testing_the_flat_build">TESTING THE &quot;FLAT&quot; BUILD</a></h2>
<p>The first task is to demonstrate that the standalone
(&quot;flat&quot;) build works. On Unix try &quot;make clean; make&quot; or on
Windows with Visual Studio[*] &quot;nmake -f NMakefile clean all&quot;:</p>
<pre>
    % make clean
    rm -f hello hello.exe hello.o*
    % make
    gcc -c hello.c
    gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
</pre>
<pre>
    % ./hello.exe
    Hello, World
</pre>
<p>As you can see this is quite a simple application and build
model.</p>
<p>[*] When using Visual Studio, all builds must take place in a
Visual Studio-enabled console window. This is one of the VS menu
options.</p>
<h2><a id=
"first_ao_build__to_generate_dependency_data">FIRST AO BUILD, TO
GENERATE DEPENDENCY DATA</a></h2>
<p>Notice that the hello app contains a directory called
<em>.ao</em>. This is the only place where per-project
configuration is kept. It's a good idea to create this directory at
the root of each AO project, <em>even if it's empty</em>, because
its presence &quot;anchors&quot; the project, telling AO where the project
is rooted and thus helping it normalize pathnames. In this case the
directory is not quite empty - we've chosen to customize the
project name by setting</p>
<pre>
    Project.Name = HelloWorld
</pre>
<p>in a properties file. The default project name is that of its
root directory; thus without this setting the project would be
named &quot;hello&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we can test dependency generation by simply prepending a few
words to the command line:</p>
<pre>
    % make clean
    % ao -MD -o@ run make
    gcc -c hello.c
    gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
</pre>
<p>The output is the same but here we have requested an audited
build and asked that the audit data be written out in makefile
syntax as dependency information. Take a look at <i>hello.o.d</i> to
see this. These files could subsequently be included within the
Makefile to provide it with complete dependency information.</p>
<h2><a id=
"using_ao_to_generate_a_new_makefile">USING AO TO GENERATE A NEW
MAKEFILE</a></h2>
<p>With a slight modification of the above:</p>
<pre>
    % make clean
    % ao -F Makefile.new -o@ run make
</pre>
<p>we can generate not just dependencies but a complete new
Makefile. You may test that the generated Makefile works via
something like:</p>
<pre>
    % make -f Makefile.new clean all
</pre>
<p>Some users may find this is all they need from <em>AO</em> and
can stop here, with no need to ever use the server.</p>
<h2><a id=
"first_ao_build_using_the_server">INITIAL AO BUILD USING THE
SERVER</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;<code>-o@</code>&quot; flag above suppressed all server
interaction, but from here on a working server is required. Test
for it by running:</p>
<pre>
    % ao ping
    localhost:8080
</pre>
<p>
You should get back a <code>server:port</code> string as shown above. If not,
make sure the server is running and that the local Server property
is configured to point to it. The current property settings can be
checked via:
</p>
<pre>    % ao -H -q
</pre>
<p>AO will talk to a configured server automatically once we stop
telling it not to:</p>
<pre>
    % make clean
    % ao run make
    gcc -c hello.c
    ao: UPLOADING hello.o
    ao: ARCHIVING hello.o
    gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
    ao: UPLOADING hello.exe
    ao: ARCHIVING hello.exe
</pre>
<p>Notice that the output is the same as before with the addition
of some UPLOADING and ARCHIVING messages. UPLOADING messages come
from the client program while the ARCHIVING lines are responses
from the server; together they say that the client uploaded copies
of two output files to the server and that the server saved
(archived) those copies.</p>
<p>Note that since <em>make</em> is such a common build tool
<em>ao</em> accepts <code>ao make</code> as a shorthand for
<code>ao run make</code>.</p>
<h2><a id=
"second_ao_build_using_the_server">RECYCLING AO BUILD USING THE
SERVER</a></h2>
<p>At this point the server database is primed with information
about commands and file states and the relationships between them.
Let's do a second build. We can also use this opportunity to show
the <code>ao make</code> shorthand. And for convenience we will
fold the clean step into a single &quot;round trip&quot; build:</p>
<pre>
    % ao make clean all
    rm -f hello hello.exe hello.o*
    gcc -c hello.c
    ao: DOWNLOADING hello.o@@20100704153239
    gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
    ao: DOWNLOADING hello.exe@@20100704153239
</pre>
<p>What happened here is that the compiler and linker did not
actually run; instead, AO intercepted them at startup, determined
that it could reuse the results of the previous build, downloaded
those files, and skipped the actual compile and link steps. The
parent program (make) continues to <em>believe</em> that the
programs ran; from its perspective nothing is different.</p>
<p>If either the command line or any of the input files had changed,
AO would have skipped this optimization and proceeded with an actual rebuild,
and of course uploaded the new result.</p>
<p>It may be hard to see any speedup with such a tiny build since
the effective build time is close to zero anyway, but on larger
builds this can produce substantial improvements in build time.</p>
<h2><a id="post_mortem_analysis">POST
MORTEM ANALYSIS</a></h2>
<p>OK, so now a couple of builds have been recorded. What can we
learn about them? First we run the &quot;lsbuilds&quot; action:</p>
<pre>
    % ao lsbuilds
    PTX            ? DURATION UP    DOWN  USER     HOST       LABEL
    20100704153239 + 00:00:00 2     0     dsb      centos5   
    20100704153319 + 00:00:00 0     2     dsb      centos5
</pre>
<p>The first column is the <em>Project Transaction</em>, or PTX,
id. This is just a unique key to identify the build. The X column
indicates build success (+) or failure (-). Duration is measured to
the granularity of seconds. The user who ran both builds was
&quot;dsb&quot;, they were both run on the machine &quot;centos5&quot;, and no
label has been applied. We can now apply labels:</p>
<pre>
    % ao label --id 20100704153239 UP
    % ao label --id 20100704153319 DOWN
</pre>
<p>and see them:</p>
<pre>
    % ao lsbuilds
    PTX            ? DURATION UP    DOWN  USER     HOST       LABEL
    20100704153239 + 00:00:00 2     0     dsb      centos5    UP
    20100704153319 + 00:00:00 0     2     dsb      centos5    DOWN
</pre>
<p>Labels simply function as a more mnemonic alias for a PTX id.
Typically these would correspond to <em>labels</em> on
version-controlled source files.</p>
<p>Now we can dig a little deeper and ask what happened during a
build:</p>
<pre>
    % ao ls --commands --extended-names
    * make clean all
      /usr/bin/make@@DOWN
      Makefile@@DOWN
</pre>
<pre>
    * /bin/sh -c rm -f hello.exe hello.o*
      /usr/bin/sh@@DOWN
      /usr/bin/rm@@DOWN
    - hello.exe
    - hello.o
</pre>
<pre>
    * gcc -c hello.c
      (RECYCLED)
</pre>
<pre>
    * gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
      (RECYCLED)
</pre>
<p>First, note that when no PTX is specified to a post-mortem
action AO defaults to the most recent one. Therefore this ended up
asking about the second build, the one which downloaded everything.
It shows that four commands were run (make, rm, gcc, and gcc
again). The latter two were short-circuited as shown by the
(RECYCLED) notation. The make program was allowed to run because
it's the control program, and rm ran because it only
<em>removed</em> files, an action which cannot be optimized
away.</p>
<p>Below each command is listed the set of files it touched. These
sets are quite small here because these commands didn't do much;
the recycled commands did nothing at all, the make program opened
its Makefile, and rm touched two files (to remove them, as
indicated by the '-'). Note that all programs will show their own
executable as a file read.</p>
<p>Last, try using the same command to look into the behavior of
the first build. This will show a lot more data since the first
build did a lot more:</p>
<pre>
    % ao ls --commands --id UP
</pre>
<p>Also try some of the other flags such as <code>--long</code></p>
<pre>
    % ao ls --commands --id UP --long
</pre>
<p>Note that &quot;<code>ao ls --help</code>&quot; will show all supported options.</p>
<h2><a id=
"steadystate_build_behavior">STEADY-STATE BUILD BEHAVIOR</a></h2>
<p>Of course nobody makes a practice of building the same code
twice just to see it go faster the second time. In real life files
change occasionally and incremental builds are done after those
changes. So let's make a trivial change to the source file and do
another build:</p>
<pre>
    echo "" &gt;&gt; hello.c
</pre>
<pre>
    % make clean
    % ao make
    gcc -c hello.c
    ao: UPLOADING hello.o
    gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
    ao: DOWNLOADING hello.exe@@20100704153239
</pre>
<p>These new results (one upload, one download) are quite
illuminating. First, the compile (gcc -c) line had to be run
because AO detected that one of the input files was different.
Since the change turned out to be semantically irrelevant, however,
the resulting hello.o was identical to its predecessor. The
client, which does not maintain state, had no way of knowing this
and sent it to the server anyway (thus the UPLOADING message). The
server, which does maintain state, recognized it as a redundant
version and threw it away so there was no ARCHIVING message this
time.</p>
<p>Next we come to the link step. As far as <em>make</em> knows, it
has rebuilt hello.o and thus needs to relink with the new version.
This is the best make can do since it maintains no state either.
AO, however, can and does figure out that the &quot;new&quot; hello.o is in
fact unchanged and knows that it can swap in the previous
executable. In short, the bogus change to the source file knocked
things off track for a little while but order was then
restored.</p>
<p>This example illustrates some of the subtleties involved in
using AO and <em>make</em> together. They are both <em>build
avoidance</em> tools; each has its idea of what needs to be done
and what can be skipped. Perhaps surprisingly, the relationship is
actually a healthy symbiotic one, though you may sometimes have to
think carefully to understand why things happened the way they did.
But then, careful thinking is in the job description.</p>
<p>The next section shows how AO could be used as the only
<em>build avoidance</em> tool.</p>
<h2><a id=
"nonmakebased_work">NON-MAKE-BASED WORK</a></h2>
<p>The same 'hello' directory contains a Java/Ant version of the
Hello World program. We can run through the same sequence using
Ant:</p>
<pre>
    % ant -q clean
    % ao run ant
    Buildfile: build.xml
</pre>
<pre>
    compile:
    [javac] Compiling 1 source file
</pre>
<pre>
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    ao: UPLOADING Hello.class
    ao: ARCHIVING Hello.class
</pre>
<pre>
    % ant -q clean
    % ao run ant
    ao: DOWNLOADING Hello.class@@20100525141218
</pre>
<p>In fact there's also a shell script to do the same build:</p>
<pre>
    % sh build.sh
    + gcc -c hello.c
    + gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
</pre>
<p>So what happens when this is run under AO? Try running the script twice under AO control:</p>
<pre>
    % ao run sh build.sh
    (output varies depending on prior state)

    % ao run sh build.sh
    ao: REUSING hello.o@@20081206164038
    ao: REUSING hello.exe@@20081206164038
</pre>
<p>Pretty much the same thing, except that it says REUSING instead
of DOWNLOADING. That happened only because this time we did not do
the equivalent of &quot;make clean&quot; to remove the previous versions,
so AO realized that the right files were already in place
allowing it to skip the download too. If we clean up manually we'll
be back to the original behavior:</p>
<pre>
    % rm -f hello.o hello.exe

    % ao run sh build.sh 
    + gcc -c hello.c
    ao: DOWNLOADING hello.o@@20081206164038
    + gcc -o hello.exe hello.o
    ao: DOWNLOADING hello.exe@@20081206164038
</pre>
<p>AO can even be used with an individual command:</p>
<pre>
    % ao run gcc -c hello.c
    ao: UPLOADING hello.o
    ao: ARCHIVING hello.o
</pre>
<pre>
    % ao run gcc -c hello.c
    ao: REUSING hello.o@@20081206164522
</pre>
<h2><a id="vcs_integration">VCS
INTEGRATION</a></h2>
<p>AO should be easy to integrate with any version control system
(VCS) capable of running triggers (aka hooks). The idea is to set
up a trigger script to map between AO metadata and VCS versions,
with the result being that AO can report <em>versions</em> of
source files rather than simple metadata. See the separate <a href=
"ao-vcs.html">AO and Version Control</a> document for details.</p>
<h2><a id="summary">SUMMARY</a></h2>
<p>AO is not an enhancement to <em>make</em> or to any other build
tool; it works with any deterministic program by sampling its
inputs and outputs, recording that metadata, and playing it back
upon request.</p>
<p>You can run nearly any program under AO control by prepending
&quot;ao run&quot; to its command line. There are a number of post-mortem
commands which may then be used; a list of these is available via
&quot;ao help&quot;, and detailed usage messages via &quot;ao help foo&quot; or
&quot;ao foo -h&quot;.</p>
<p>There are many more features of AO and a number of other
documents which describe them. The purpose of this document is
simply to get you started.</p>
