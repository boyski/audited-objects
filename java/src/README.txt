Note that I (original author) am not an expert Java developer.However, it made sense that the AO server be written in Java,with the result that what you see here is the effort of a self-taught
Java programmer. After a couple of rewrites it's as good as I know
how to make it, but I'd be happy to consider suggestions, patches,
or refactorings contributed by people with expertise of longer
standing.
