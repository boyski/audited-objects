PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE BUILD MODELS</a></h2>
<p>This document discusses the structural and philosophical
differences between the build models of open source software and of
commercial and/or proprietary software.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking there are two software build philosophies which
may be characterized as &quot;build once, run many&quot; (BORM) and &quot;build
many, run once&quot; (BMRO). Consider the requirements for an open
source package such as Perl or gcc; it must build on an extremely
wide variety of target platforms, some dating back decades. The
developers may not have access to all supported platforms. Support
for obsolete platforms is rarely withdrawn, and in fact it often
must be buildable on platforms which did not exist at the time of
release.</p>
<p>It must also be easily built by people who are not expert with
that product and perhaps not with software development at all. The
major goal is to get it built <em>one time</em> on just about any
platform by hook or by crook; once built and installed, that binary
may be used for years before being updated. A
corollary of this is that nobody cares how long the build takes,
since it runs just the one time. Another is that aggressive optimization of
the final product is usually sacrificed in the interest of
portability, and another is that any ugly hack is tolerable. This is
the <em>BORM</em> philosophy, and the great majority of open-source
tools subscribe to it.</p>

<p>When a software business is building its own product, however, the
incentives are reversed. The build may be run many times per day by
multiple users as part of an agile methodology, or at least there may
be a nightly build. Developers may rebuild nearly every time
they change a source file. Meanwhile, the software is typically
targeted at a tightly controlled set of supported platforms, all
of which are accessible to build maintainers, and support for old
systems is removed (&quot;sunsetted&quot;) on a regular basis. Expertise on
how the build works is generally in-house, and the organization
finds a significant advantage both in speeding up the build and in
optimizing the delivered binaries. The results of each
nightly/integration build are typically run through some sort of
test cycle, after which bug reports are filed or closed, and the
cycle repeats. The great majority of generated bits are thrown away
after the testing cycle. This is the <em>BMRO</em> model as widely
used in proprietary, for-profit software development shops.</p>
<p>There are two additional obstructions to good build practice in
open source code. First is the compatibility risk factor: imagine
that a mysterious, even ugly, construct is found to have been
present in the build tooling for years. Nobody remembers why
it's there and it's impossible to prove that it's not a workaround
to an obscure problem on an old platform which may still be in use
somewhere, since no one site has access to all potential platforms.
So the decision generally is to leave it alone no matter how ugly.
Second is the fun factor: people work on open source code to please
themselves, because they want to invent something cool or to add a
feature for which they have a personal use. Developers do not
usually flock to an OSS project in order to streamline the build
model. In most cases they're not using agile methodologies, which
place a premium on fast build turnaround. None of this is to say
that OSS programmers don't care about quality; they do, but they
rarely have a vested interest in <em>build</em> quality.</p>

<p>In summary, open source (BORM) packages are generally willing to
tolerate a great deal of inefficiency in their builds in return for
better support of boundary cases like weird platforms or naive
users, while proprietary SW organizations can and do legislate
those cases out of existence in order to optimize the rest.
A good example is the &quot;libtool&quot;
program used by many OSS packages to generate libraries by
dynamically determining which flags to pass to the linker. In a
randomly chosen test (PCRE) it was found that one invocation of
libtool ran the sed utility <strong>71 times</strong>, grep
<strong>20 times</strong>, and overall required a total of
<strong>117 child processes</strong> to build a simple shared
library! This may make sense for supporting unknown, exotic
platforms but a BMRO organization is generally better advised to
determine the ideal set of compiler/linker/etc flags for their
target platforms and simply use them. Not only does this save
perhaps an order of magnitude on process overhead but it tends to
result in better-optimized and better-understood deliverables.</p>

<p>Since AO has a constant overhead per audited process, BORM
models which invoke dozens or even hundreds of shell utilities per
generated file make it work extra hard and hurt its perceived
performance. This makes BORM models a great stress test for AO,
while BMRO models will generally be a more comfortable fit and should
run more efficiently with AO.</p>
