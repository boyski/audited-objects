<h1 style="text-align:center;"><a id="ao_installation">AO INSTALLATION</a></h1>

<p>AO comprises a client-side program plus an optional server.
Manual installation is straightforward. The server should be installed just once on a single
server machine while the client install is per machine or, if a network file
system is used, per supported platform. In fact the server may not be required at all;
some functions, such as Makefile dependency generation, require only a client.</p>

<h2><a id="downloading">DOWNLOADING</a></h2>

<p>Start by <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audited-objects/">downloading the entire product set</a>.
Or you may skip the server and <a href="../../client/">grab client packages directly</a>.
If necessary, the client packages may be manually extracted from the <code>AO.war</code> file contained in
the main distribution (<code>.war</code> is a standard zip format and can be opened by any zip program).
</p>
<p></p><hr />

<h2><a id="client_installation">CLIENT INSTALLATION</a></h2>

<h3><a id="unix_clients">UNIX CLIENTS</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="../../client/">client packages</a> are in gzipped tar files named something like</p>
<pre>        ao-Linux_i386-2.3.2.tar.gz<br />        ao-SunOS_sparc-5.9.tar.gz</pre>

<p>The version number describes the earliest OS release supported. In the special
case of Linux it refers to the earliest supported version of <em>glibc</em>
rather than an OS/distro version.</p>

<p>The client install is as simple as extracting the tar file into the
<em>install-base</em> directory. For instance, for personal use or evaluation
place it in your home directory:</p>
<pre>    % cd ~<br />    % gtar -xzvf /tmp/ao-Linux_i386-2.3.2.tar.gz<br />    % export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin</pre>

<p>Or if you prefer to install for general use in /opt/local/bin:</p>
<pre>    % cd /opt/local<br />    % gtar -xzvf /tmp/ao-Linux_i386-2.3.2.tar.gz<br />    % export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin</pre>

<p>Etc. This may be done for each client system or just once in a
globally-mounted location. The important thing is that the <em>ao</em> program
should be on your PATH in <em>install-base</em>/bin while the library is "just around the
corner" in <em>install-base</em>/lib with the config files in <em>install-base</em>/etc.
The two binary files must be executable but need no special privileges.</p>

<p>The client is configured via a hierarchy of <em>properties files</em>. The
full hierarchy is described in the user documentation but for initial
installation a sample properties file is provided at
<em>install-base</em>/etc/ao.properties-sample. Rename this to remove the
<em>-sample</em>. Thus, following the example above:</p>
<pre>    % cd <em>install-base</em>/etc<br />    % mv ao.properties-sample ao.properties<br />    <br /></pre>

Once the <i>ao</i> program is on your PATH you should be able
to audit any program by simply prepending "ao -o- run". E.g.
<p></p>
<pre>    % uname<br />    SunOS</pre>
<pre>    % ao -o - run uname<br />    SunOS<br />    20953,0,20952,kk7bb4.8b5crc,0.bsds,u20,,uname,,-,-,11v4914+5,1gla0x6-1,uname<br />    X,init,0.0,20953,0,20952,0,-,-,11v4914+5,f,?,iar056.0,9948,pkd,,,/sbin/uname
<br /></pre>
If the program returns output similar to the above and an exit status of 0, client installation succeeded.
The &quot;-o&quot; told it to dump the audit to a file instead of sending it to a server and the
value &quot;-&quot; named that file as standard output. The output itself is rather cryptic but essentially
the first line describes the audited command itself and the second describes the only file it opened.

<h4><a id="setuid_use">SETUID USE</a></h4>

<p>In order for AO to audit a setuid program the <code>libao.so</code> file
must be marked as a <em>trusted library</em>. This is handled differently on
different platforms; e.g. on Linux it must be listed in /etc/ld.so.conf. See
<i>man ld.so</i> for details. On Solaris see <i>man ld.so.1</i> and <i>man crle</i></p>.

<h3><a id="windows_clients">WINDOWS CLIENTS</a></h3>

<p>The Windows client install is similar except that the zip file should be
extracted directly into a folder which is on %PATH%. The properties file
belongs in %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id="server_installation">SERVER INSTALLATION</a></h2>

<p>The AO server is a standard Java web application. It
<em>should</em> work with any servlet container conforming to <em>Servlet
API 2.4</em> running under Java 5 or above, but it has only been tested with
Tomcat (the most widely used free container), and only Tomcat installation is covered here. Specifically, AO has been
tested with Tomcat 6.x running under Java 5 and Java 6 VMs.
Other containers have been tried and observed to work at various times.</p>

<p>Also, note that while a servlet container may manage any number of web
applications, this document describes an arrangement in which AO runs in a
dedicated Tomcat installation. Sharing AO with other apps in a container is not
hard but is left as an exercise for expert users.</p>

<p>The server is typically installed on just one machine. Since it is written
in pure Java, the host may be any system running a Java 5 or newer SDK. The AO
server runs within a <code>servlet container</code> which in turn runs within a
Java virtual machine.</p>

<p>For experienced users, the AO server install boils down to (a) install Tomcat,
(b) copy <code>AO.war</code> into its ./webapps subdirectory and (c) start Tomcat. That's
all, really. For details, read on.</p>

<h3><a id="installing_the_java_sdk">INSTALLING
THE JAVA SDK</a></h3>

<p>Tomcat requires Java, and many systems will already have a compatible
version installed. You will need Java 5 or better. Binaries can be found at <a href="http://java.sun.com.">http://java.sun.com.</a></p>

<h3><a id="installing_tomcat">INSTALLING
TOMCAT</a></h3>

<p>Tomcat may be obtained from <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org.">http://tomcat.apache.org.</a> Get the latest
binary version. Since it's pure Java there's just one binary for all platforms;
however, that build is packaged differently for Unix and Windows. Make sure to
get the appropriate package for your platform: .zip or .exe for Windows,
.tar.gz for all others. The primary difference is that the config files may
have Unix line endings in the tar packages and Windows line endings in the
.zip/.exe.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a id="item_unix">Unix</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">You need only extract the Tomcat tar file into
    its final install location. Actually, it's also necessary to make sure that
    at least the 'log' and 'work' subdirectories within this area are writeable
    by the user as which Tomcat will be running. The simplest solution is to
    <code>chown -R</code> the entire directory tree to be owned by that user,
    but there are other ways. You may also prefer to use a symbolic link
    to simplify configuration. For instance:<p></p>
    <pre>    % cd /opt<br />    % gtar -xzf /tmp/apache-tomcat-6.0.18.tar.gz<br />    % chown -R $LOGNAME apache-tomcat-6.0.18<br />    % ln -s apache-tomcat-6.0.18 tomcat</pre>
    <p>The directory containing Tomcat (<code>/opt/tomcat</code> here) will be
    known as <em>AOSERVER_HOME</em> below.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a id="item_windows">Windows</a></strong><br />
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;">Tomcat for Windows can be installed just as
    above, using the .zip version of the same package. But it's also available
    as a <em>tomcat.exe</em> installer which offers the advantages of GUI
    installation, automatic creation of a service to keep Tomcat running, etc. Whichever
    format you choose, the instructions provided with Tomcat are simple and
    clear.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default Tomcat listens on port 8080. AO is happy to use that port or any
other. If you need to switch to a different port, edit
$AOSERVER_HOME/conf/server.xml, find the place which says <em>port="8080"</em> and
change it. If running, Tomcat must then be restarted.</p>

<p>At this point you should be able to get Tomcat running, using either the
Windows service or the startup
scripts in <em>AOSERVER_HOME</em>/bin. Test it by pointing a browser at it on the
appropriate port - for instance <a href="http://localhost:8080/.">http://localhost:8080/.</a> You should see a
"Congratulations on Your Successful Installation of Tomcat" page. Techniques
for starting and stopping Tomcat and troubleshooting are well covered in the
Tomcat documentation and need not be discussed here.</p>

<p>Stop Tomcat again before proceeding.</p>

<h3><a id="deploying_the_ao_server">DEPLOYING
THE AO SERVER WEB APP</a></h3>

<p>The AO server is packaged as a <em>Web ARchive</em> or <em>WAR</em> file
named <strong>AO.war</strong> inside a zipfile. Download it
from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/audited-objects/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Copy <code>AO.war</code> into the <code>$AOSERVER_HOME/webapps</code>
directory. E.g. if Tomcat is installed in <code>/opt/tomcat</code>, then the
file should end up at <code>/opt/tomcat/webapps/AO.war</code>.</p>

<h4><a id="starting_the_server__unix_">STARTING THE SERVER (UNIX)</a></h4>
If you've reached this point you already know a way to start Tomcat. However,
AO comes with its own startup script which may simplify the process. It's
packaged within <code>AO.war</code> as a tar file called
<a href="../../etc/ao-server-unix-startup.tar.gz">ao-server-unix-startup.tar.gz</a> containing the script
itself plus a separate config file. Place both files in the service-startup
area appropriate to your platform. In many Unix versions and Linux
distributions this is <em>/etc/init.d</em>. In others it may be
<em>/etc/rc.d/init.d</em> or thereabouts. Important: make the script
executable, and <em>make the config file be owned by the username under which
the server will run</em>. 

<p>The <em>aoserver</em> file is the main startup script and should need no
modifications, because all tuneable parameters are set in the config file. In
particular, JAVA_HOME <em>must</em> be set in <em>aoserver.cfg</em> to point to
the location of the JDK such that java can be invoked as $JAVA_HOME/bin/java,
and AOSERVER_HOME must be the location of the Tomcat server such that the path to
<em>AO.war</em> is <code>$AOSERVER_HOME/webapps/AO.war</code>.</p>

<p><em>Pay special attention to the comment associated with AOSERVER_USER!</em></p>

<p>For an evaluation install the server may be run under your own userid. In
production, a pseudo-user is the more common technique. A typical
<em>aoserver.cfg</em> file might look like:</p>
<pre>    JAVA_HOME=/usr/java<br />    JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms128M -Xmx512M"<br />    AOSERVER_HOME=/opt/tomcat<br />    AOSERVER_USER=(userid)</pre>

<p>with comments stripped out. Note that <em>(userid)</em> must be replaced
with your preferred user id.</p>

<p>With the above in place, the server can be started by running</p>
<pre>    aoserver start</pre>

<p>and stopped via</p>
<pre>    aoserver stop</pre>

<p>assuming the <em>aoserver</em> script is on your PATH.</p>

<p>It may be instructive to run "pgrep java" (Solaris and Linux)
<em>before</em> starting aoserver to see what JVMs might already be running.
Then use it again afterwards to make sure a new JVM has started.</p>

<p>Links may also be placed in the <em>rc2.d</em> and/or <em>rc3.d</em>
directories to cause the server to start automatically at bootup in the classic
Unix way. These details may vary with the specific Unix version.
Bottom line, Tomcat is just another service - you may use whatever
infrastructure your platform provides for managing services.</p>

<p>When using the <em>aoserver</em> script manually, additional options are
available. Run <em>aoserver</em> with no arguments to see a help message
describing these.</p>

<h4><a id="starting_the_server__windows_">STARTING THE SERVER
(WINDOWS)</a></h4>

<p>It's assumed that the service manager which comes bundled with
<em>tomcat.exe</em> will be used. There are other ways to set up a service on
Windows but they are not covered here. The name of the Tomcat 6 service is
<em>tomcat6</em>; thus it may be stopped with "net stop tomcat6" and and
started with "net start tomcat6". Alternatively the services panel may be
used (run "services.msc"); in this GUI, the service is known as <em>Apache
Tomcat</em>.</p><a id="testing">TESTING</a>

<p>Once the client is installed and the server started, try the following
command:</p>
<pre>    ao -s server:port ping</pre>

<p>where <em>server</em> is the name of the server machine and <em>port</em> is
the port on which the server is listening, 8080 by default. If this command
echoes back the <code>server:port</code> string, installation was successful.
For example:</p>
<pre>    % ao -s localhost:8080 ping<br />    localhost:8080</pre>

<p></p><hr />

<h2><a id="basic_configuration">BASIC
CONFIGURATION</a></h2>

<p>To avoid having to specify the server string each time, edit the
<em>ao.properties</em> file you created above, or make a new one in
<em>$HOME/ao.properties</em> (or <em>%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%\ao.properties</em>
on Windows), and set the following property:</p>
<pre>    Server = server:port</pre>

<p>Where <code>server:port</code> is the same string you passed with -s above.
As previously noted, AO can be configured via a hierarchy of properties files.
The difference between these two is that the one in the <em>etc</em> directory
applies to all users of this installation while the one in <em>$HOME</em> is
personal.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to run simply</p>
<pre>    ao ping</pre>

<p>and get the same successful response.</p>

<h2><a id="sitespecific_server_configuration__advanced_">SITE-SPECIFIC SERVER
CONFIGURATION (ADVANCED)</a></h2>

<p>AO has many properties which are set by the client and thus may vary per
user, per system, or per project. There's another set of properties, however,
which are belong to the server and represent site policy. These are controlled from the
server side and can be set only at server startup time.</p>

<p>At startup, the server looks for a <em>system</em> property called
"AO.Server.Properties" whose value, if present, should be the path to a properties file. If this
property is set <em>and</em> the file exists, the server reads site properties
from it. On Unix, for example, and assuming Tomcat is installed to /opt/tomcat,
you might choose to create the file /opt/tomcat/AO-Server.properties and then
modify the <em>aoserver.cfg</em> file to pass
"-DAO.Server.Properties=/opt/tomcat/AO-Server.properties" using the JAVA_OPTS
variable.</p>

<p>The documented site properties are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a id="item_ao_2econtainer_2eroot">AO.Container.Root</a></strong><br />
    AO stores file data in a directory called "AO_FILE_CONTAINERS" which by default
    is placed within the webapp's context directory. On Unix, assuming Tomcat
    was installed into /opt/tomcat, this would be something like
    /opt/tomcat/webapps/AO/AO_FILE_CONTAINERS. It may make sense to place these
    data containers into a different/larger filesystem. This can be done via the
    property "AO.Container.Root". For instance, setting
    <code>AO.Container.Root=/tmp</code> would cause container data to end up
    under /tmp/AO_FILE_CONTAINERS.</li>
</ul>
You may also use this file to override other properties, specifically the
database-related settings in <em>persistence.xml</em>. This is the best way to
reconfigure the database without having to modify the server's internal files.
A sample server properties file is provided at <a href="../../etc/AO-Server.properties">Sample AO-Server.properties</a>. 

<h2><a id="enabling_persistence">ENABLING PERSISTENCE</a></h2>

<p>In order to turn on data persistence, first set up site-specific configuration as
detailed above using the <a href="../../etc/AO-Server.properties">Sample AO-Server.properties</a>.
Then choose your database (<a href="http://h2database.com">H2</a> is the default).
If you choose anything other than the default, there may be additional work to get that
particular database running. Once the database is working, you need to adjust the JDBC URL
accordingly. For H2, use <i>javax.persistence.jdbc.url = jdbc:h2:DIRECTORY-PATH;create=true</i>
in order to place the persistent data in <i>DIRECTORY-PATH</i>.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE THAT PERSISTENT BEHAVIOR IS NOT STRESS TESTED AND SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A
PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE TIME BEING.</b></p>

<h2><a id="troubleshooting">TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h2>

<p>There is a lot of documentation and troubleshooting help available at <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a> for Java and <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">http://tomcat.apache.org</a> for Tomcat. These
are your best sources of help for infrastructure problems. Tomcat also
maintains a set of logfiles in $AOSERVER_HOME/logs.</p>
