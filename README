Audited Objects (AO) is a tool for the analysis and optimization of
automated software processes such as builds. When a build process
is run under AO control, each command executed is recorded in a
central database along with a record of each file opened by that
command and its state (checksum/size/timestamp) as of the instant
it was opened. A full copy of each modified file is stored in
the database as well.

AO has much in common with clearmake, the IBM Rational build tool,
but unlike clearmake it's not a build tool per se; instead,
it injects its auditing capabilities into the build tool of
your choice.
