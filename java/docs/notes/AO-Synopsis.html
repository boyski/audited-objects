<p>
<b>Audited Objects</b> (AO) is a tool for the <i>analysis</i> and
<i>optimization</i> of software builds. When any build process is run under AO
control, every command executed is recorded in a central database along
with a record of each file opened by that command and its state
(size/date/checksum) at the time. Additionally, a full copy of each
<i>modified</i> file is stored.
</p>

<p>
Once this data is collected, AO provides a suite of tools for analyzing it.
In particular, given a binary file built under AO control (even one
sent in from the field) an AO user can determine the <i>complete</i>
set of input files which contributed to it, including source files,
build scripts, compilers, header files, libraries, etc.  In the
case of source files which are version controlled, the versions of
each contributor can be determined as well. There are many uses for
this information, too many to elaborate here, but the obvious one
is to recreate the environment in which a binary file was built for
the purpose of making a patch.
</p>

<p>
AO also allows for <i>build-optimization-by-sharing</i>. Imagine a team
of developers including Alex, Claire, and Jeffrey. One day Alex
changes a global header file, necessitating a full rebuild for
anyone working on the latest branch. Claire is the first to update
her source files and learn this; she starts a build and goes to
lunch. A little later Jeffrey updates his sources and starts his
own build. AO will immediately discover that Claire has already
built the same objects; it knows that since the input set is
identical and the commands are identical, the results must also be
the same so it simply serves Claire's results from its database
into Jeffrey's workspace. These shared output files are said to be
<i>recycled</i>.
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of Jeffrey (and anyone building after him)
everything works just as before - the same commands were run and the
correct output produced, but it all happened nearly
instantaneously.  The scenario described here is the best case; in
a more normal steady-state use case developers will share build
artifacts back and forth, and most builds will involve some mixture of
recycled and new objects.
</p>

<p>
A recommended way to make use of this feature is to run nightly
builds under AO control, such that when developers arrive in the
morning the objects they'll need are likely to be waiting in a warm
cache. Thus, you could think of AO as a DVR for builds; record them
as they happen in the middle of the night, then play them back -
skipping the boring parts - when you find it more convenient,
during the day (the analogy is imperfect but still useful).
</p>


<p>
Notes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Although the obvious use case is software builds, AO can be used in
any process which is both <i>deterministic</i> and <i>file-based</i>
(meaning that both input and output consist of file data).
</li>
<li>
AO is not a build tool itself a la <i>make</i>. It can be used
with any deterministic command, a category which includes but
is not limited to <i>make</i> programs.
</li>
<li>
AO is not limited to local-area network use; as long as bandwidth is
sufficient it can be used by distributed teams as well.
</li>
</ul>
