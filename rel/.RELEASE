- Make sure release notes are up to date.

- Change version numbers in App.properties, *.vcproj, and server side.

- Build on all release platforms.

- Run a test cycle.

- Copy binary packages into Eclipse server package.

- Export server as AO.war.

- Wrap the AO.war in a AO-x.y.z.zip file.

- Move both AO.war and AO-x.y.z.zip to the Unix side.

- Push the zipfile up to SF.net using sf-upload script.

- Start a shell on SF using the sf-shell script.

(Now on SF.net server):

=> Cd to ~/ao-files (/home/frs/project/a/au/audited-objects).

=> Extract the .war file and move it to ~/ao-docs (/home/project-web/audited-objects/htdocs/).

=> Cd to ~/ao-docs and unzip the .war file there ("unzip -o -q AO.war").
