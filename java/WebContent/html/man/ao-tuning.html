AO</a></h1>
<p>This is a set of informal notes on things you may consider doing
to make your tools work better with AO. Whether your build uses <i>make</i>
or not, you should read the <a href="ao-make.html">ao-make</a> document
because it discusses important related concepts, in particular the importance
of optimized aggregation.</p>

<h2><a id="network_file_systems">Network File Systems</a></h2>
<p>AO needs access to the metadata of each file used, as it is
used. This is generally done via the <code>stat()</code> system
call family on Unix and GetFile{Attributes,Size,Type}() on Windows.
At least with traditional Unix NFS, these system calls are
substantially slower than on native/local file systems because they
tend to require round-trip network traffic. This in turn causes AO
to work more slowly on NFS-mounted file data.</p>
<p>I'm always looking for ways of reducing the number of stat calls in
AO. In the meantime, if AO is not as fast as desired over NFS, consider
running it in a local file system. There may also be ways of tuning
NFS to speed up and/or cache stat calls, and newer NFS versions may
do a better job. This area is still being researched.</p>
