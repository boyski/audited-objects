Users new to AO should always start with the <a href="demo.tar.gz">Demo Package</a>.
Note that this is not part of the AO tool proper and is provided for
test and demo purposes only. Warning: line endings
on a few files, in particular .bat scripts, may need to be adjusted for Windows.
</p>
<p>
The&quot;hello&quot; subdirectory of the demo package contains a simple&quot;Hello World&quot; program.
This is the simplest demo and generally should be tried first. It is what's
used in the <a href="../html/man/ao-tour.html">Tour of AO</a> document.
It's provided with both a Makefile and a build.sh script for Unix build purposes,
as well as a NMakefile (e.g.&quot;nmake -f NMakefile&quot;) and a build.bat script for
Windows. Finally, there's a Java version which may be built with Ant.
Any of these build tools may be used with AO; in fact that's the point of the HelloWorld demo.

<p>
Open-source applications are an ideal way to exercise AO, and I use many for testing.
Here is a partial list of some open source packages I've used AO with. These would be
good candidates with which to try out AO.

Each of these will have its own configuration instructions but for Unix most
are of the common "./configure; make" variety. Building for Windows is usually
more complex; see individual package documentation.

<p>
Note that open source software is a particularly hostile environment for AO, for
reasons elaborated below. For us this makes it an ideal test platform, and for you
it means that <i>AO will generally perform better with your own builds than it does
with open source</i>. This conclusion may seem a bit surprising, so
<a href="../html/man/ao-buildmodels.html">supporting arguments</a> are provided.
There's also a document on <a href="../html/man/ao-tuning.html">tuning a build for AO</a>
which covers related topics.
